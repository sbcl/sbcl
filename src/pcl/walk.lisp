;;;; environment hacking stuff, necessarily SBCL-specific

;;; Here in the original PCL were implementations of the
;;; implementation-specific environment hacking functions for each of
;;; the implementations this walker had been ported to. This
;;; functionality was originally factored out in order to make PCL
;;; portable from one Common Lisp to another. As of 19981107, that
;;; portability was fairly stale and (because of the scarcity of CLTL1
;;; implementations and the strong interdependence of the rest of ANSI
;;; Common Lisp on the CLOS system) fairly irrelevant. It was fairly
;;; thoroughly put out of its misery by WHN in his quest to clean up
;;; the system enough that it can be built from scratch using any ANSI
;;; Common Lisp.
;;;
;;; This code just hacks 'macroexpansion environments'. That is, it is
;;; only concerned with the function binding of symbols in the
;;; environment. The walker needs to be able to tell if the symbol
;;; names a lexical macro or function, and it needs to be able to
;;; build environments which contain lexical macro or function
;;; bindings. It must be able, when walking a MACROLET, FLET or LABELS
;;; form to construct an environment which reflects the bindings
;;; created by that form. Note that the environment created does NOT
;;; have to be sufficient to evaluate the body, merely to walk its
;;; body. This means that definitions do not have to be supplied for
;;; lexical functions, only the fact that that function is bound is
;;; important. For macros, the macroexpansion function must be
;;; supplied.
;;;
;;; This code is organized in a way that lets it work in
;;; implementations that stack cons their environments. That is
;;; reflected in the fact that the only operation that lets a user
;;; build a new environment is a WITH-BODY macro which executes its
;;; body with the specified symbol bound to the new environment. No
;;; code in this walker or in PCL will hold a pointer to these
;;; environments after the body returns. Other user code is free to do
;;; so in implementations where it works, but that code is not
;;; considered portable.
;;;
;;; There are 3 environment hacking tools. One macro,
;;; WITH-AUGMENTED-ENVIRONMENT, which is used to create new
;;; environments, and two functions, ENVIRONMENT-FUNCTION and
;;; ENVIRONMENT-MACRO, which are used to access the bindings of
;;; existing environments

;;; In SBCL, as in CMU CL before it, the environment is represented
;;; with a structure that holds alists for the functional things,
;;; variables, blocks, etc. Except for SYMBOL-MACROLET, only the
;;; SB-C::LEXENV-FUNS slot is relevant. It holds: Alist (Name . What),
;;; where What is either a functional (a local function) or a list
;;; (MACRO . <function>) (a local macro, with the specifier expander.)
;;; Note that Name may be a (SETF <name>) function. Accessors are
;;; defined below, eg (ENV-WALK-FUNCTION ENV).
;;;
;;; If WITH-AUGMENTED-ENVIRONMENT is called from WALKER-ENVIRONMENT-BIND
;;; this code hides the WALKER version of an environment
;;; inside the SB-C::LEXENV structure.
;;;
;;; In CMUCL (and former SBCL), This used to be a list of lists of form
;;; (<gensym-name> MACRO . #<interpreted-function>) in the :functions slot
;;; in a C::LEXENV.
;;; This form was accepted by the compiler, but this was a crude hack,
;;; because the <interpreted-function> was used as a structure to hold the
;;; bits of interest, {function, form, declarations, lexical-variables},
;;; a list, which was not really an interpreted function.
;;; Instead this list was COERCEd to a #<FUNCTION ...>!
;;;
;;; Instead, we now use a special sort of "function"-type for that
;;; information, because the functions slot in SB-C::LEXENV is
;;; supposed to have a list of <Name MACRO . #<function> elements.
;;; So, now we hide our bits of interest in the walker-info slot in
;;; our new BOGO-FUN.
;;;
;;; MACROEXPAND-1 and SB-INT:EVAL-IN-LEXENV are the only SBCL
;;; functions that get called with the constructed environment
;;; argument.

;;;; handling of special forms

;;; Here are some comments from the original PCL on the difficulty of
;;; doing this portably across different CLTL1 implementations. This
;;; is no longer directly relevant because this code now only runs on
;;; SBCL, but the comments are retained for culture: they might help
;;; explain some of the design decisions which were made in the code.
;;;
;;; and I quote...
;;;
;;;     The set of special forms is purposely kept very small because
;;;     any program analyzing program (read code walker) must have
;;;     special knowledge about every type of special form. Such a
;;;     program needs no special knowledge about macros...
;;;
;;; So all we have to do here is a define a way to store and retrieve
;;; templates which describe how to walk the 24 special forms and we
;;; are all set...
;;;
;;; Well, its a nice concept, and I have to admit to being naive
;;; enough that I believed it for a while, but not everyone takes
;;; having only 24 special forms as seriously as might be nice. There
;;; are (at least) 3 ways to lose:
;;
;;;   1 - Implementation x implements a Common Lisp special form as
;;;       a macro which expands into a special form which:
;;;      - Is a common lisp special form (not likely)
;;;      - Is not a common lisp special form (on the 3600 IF --> COND).
;;;
;;;     * We can save ourselves from this case (second subcase really)
;;;       by checking to see whether there is a template defined for
;;;       something before we check to see whether we can macroexpand it.
;;;
;;;   2 - Implementation x implements a Common Lisp macro as a special form.
;;;
;;;     * This is a screw, but not so bad, we save ourselves from it by
;;;       defining extra templates for the macros which are *likely* to
;;;       be implemented as special forms. [Note: As of sbcl-0.6.9, these
;;;       extra templates have been deleted, since this is not a problem
;;;       in SBCL and we no longer try to make this walker portable
;;;       across other possibly-broken CL implementations.]
;;;
;;;   3 - Implementation x has a special form which is not on the list of
;;;       Common Lisp special forms.
;;;
;;;     * This is a bad sort of a screw and happens more than I would
;;;       like to think, especially in the implementations which provide
;;;       more than just Common Lisp (3600, Xerox etc.).
;;;       The fix is not terribly satisfactory, but will have to do for
;;;       now. There is a hook in get walker-template which can get a
;;;       template from the implementation's own walker. That template
;;;       has to be converted, and so it may be that the right way to do
;;;       this would actually be for that implementation to provide an
;;;       interface to its walker which looks like the interface to this
;;;       walker.

;;;; examples

#|
;;; Here are some examples of the kinds of things you should be able
;;; to do with your implementation of the macroexpansion environment
;;; hacking mechanism.
;;;
;;; WITH-LEXICAL-MACROS is kind of like MACROLET, but it only takes
;;; names of the macros and actual macroexpansion functions to use to
;;; macroexpand them. The win about that is that for macros which want
;;; to wrap several MACROLETs around their body, they can do this but
;;; have the macroexpansion functions be compiled. See the WITH-RPUSH
;;; example.
;;;
;;; If the implementation had a special way of communicating the
;;; augmented environment back to the evaluator that would be totally
;;; great. It would mean that we could just augment the environment
;;; then pass control back to the implementations own compiler or
;;; interpreter. We wouldn't have to call the actual walker. That
;;; would make this much faster. Since the principal client of this is
;;; defmethod it would make compiling defmethods faster and that would
;;; certainly be a win.
