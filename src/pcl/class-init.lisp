;;;; FINDING SLOT DEFINITIONS
;;;
;;; Historical PCL found slot definitions by iterating over
;;; CLASS-SLOTS, which is O(N) for number of slots, and moreover
;;; requires a GF call (for SLOT-DEFINITION-NAME) for each slot in
;;; list up to the desired one.
;;;
;;; Current SBCL hashes the effective slot definitions, and some
;;; information pulled out from them into a simple-vector, with bucket
;;; chains made out of plists keyed by the slot names. This fixes
;;; gives O(1) performance, and avoid the GF calls.
;;;
;;; MAKE-SLOT-TABLE constructs the hashed vector out of a list of
;;; effective slot definitions and the class they pertain to, and
;;; FIND-SLOT-DEFINITION knows how to look up slots in that vector.
;;;
;;; The only bit of cleverness in the implementation is to make the
;;; vectors fairly tight, but always longer then 0 elements:
