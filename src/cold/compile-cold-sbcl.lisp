;;; FIXME: I think it's a mistake that we load muffler twice in
;;; make-host-2 (once for the host, once for XC), because the host
;;; should produce no new warnings, and because it's really hard
;;; to think straight when you figure that we're using the host's
;;; SIGNAL and type system but mixing it with our types.
;;; We can just bake in some behavior to the cross-compiler never to warn
;;; about sh*t that we think isn't warning-worthy.
;;; (i.e. do it in source code using #[-+]sb-xc-host).
;;; The target compiler will still get everything as usual.

;;; Ordinarily the types carried around as "handled conditions" while compiling
;;; have been parsed into internal CTYPE objects. However, using parsed objects
;;; in the cross-compiler was confusing as hell.
;;; Consider any toplevel form in make-host-2 - it will have constants in it,
;;; and we need to know if each constant is dumpable. So we call DUMPABLE-LEAFLIKE-P
;;; which invokes SB-XC:TYPEP. But SB-XC:TYPEP may know nothing of a particular struct type
;;; until that DEFSTRUCT is seen. So how did it ever work? Well, for starters,
;;; if it's an unknown type, we need to signal a PARSE-UNKNOWN-TYPE condition.
;;; To signal that, we check whether that condition is in *HANDLED-CONDITIONS*.
;;; The way we tested that is to unparse the entry and then use CL:TYPEP on the
;;; specifier.  (rev 2bad5ce54d5692a0 "Represent LEXENV-HANDLED-CONDITIONS as CTYPEs")
;;; So we had:
;;;   (HANDLE-CONDITION-P #<PARSE-UNKNOWN-TYPE {1003172603}>)
;;;   -> (UNION-UNPARSE-TYPE-METHOD #<UNION-TYPE (OR (SATISFIES UNABLE-TO-OPTIMIZE-NOTE-P) ...)>)
;;;   -> (TYPE= #<UNION-TYPE (OR (SATISFIES UNABLE-TO-OPTIMIZE-NOTE-P) ...)> #<UNION-TYPE LIST>)
;;;   -> ... lots more frames ...
;;;   -> (CTYPEP NIL #<HAIRY-TYPE (SATISFIES UNABLE-TO-OPTIMIZE-NOTE-P)>)
;;; While means while merely unparsing, we have to reason about UNION-TYPE
;;; and UNKNOWN-TYPE, which might entail invoking (CROSS-TYPEP 'NIL #<an-unknown-type>)
;;; i.e. we can't even unparse a parsed type without reasoning about whether
;;; we should signal a condition about the condition we're trying to signal.
;;; That could only be described as an unmitigated disaster.
;;; So now, as a special case within the cross-compiler, *HANDLED-CONDITIONS*
;;; uses type designators instead of parsed types.
