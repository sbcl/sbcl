(defparameter *expected-stem-flags*
  '(;; meaning: This file is needed to generate C headers if doing so
    ;; independently of make-host-1
    :c-headers
    ;; meaning: This file is not to be compiled when building the
    ;; cross-compiler which runs on the host ANSI Lisp. ("not host
    ;; code", i.e. does not execute on host -- but may still be
    ;; cross-compiled by the host, so that it executes on the target)
    :not-host
    ;; meaning: This file is not to be compiled as part of the target
    ;; SBCL. ("not target code" -- but still presumably host code,
    ;; used to support the cross-compilation process)
    :not-target
    ;; meaning: The #'COMPILE-STEM argument :TRACE-FILE should be T.
    ;; When the compiler is SBCL's COMPILE-FILE or something like it,
    ;; compiling "foo.lisp" will generate "foo.trace" which contains lots
    ;; of exciting low-level information about representation selection,
    ;; VOPs used by the compiler, and bits of assembly.
    :trace-file
    ;; meaning: When cold-loading this file while producing the
    ;; initial cold core, genesis should produce a trace file of the
    ;; fops (fasl operations) executed.
    :foptrace-file
    ;; meaning: The #'COMPILE-STEM argument :BLOCK-COMPILE should be
    ;; T. That is, the entire file will be block compiled. Like
    ;; :TRACE-FILE, this applies to all COMPILE-FILEs which support
    ;; something like :BLOCK-COMPILE.
    :block-compile
    ;; meaning: This file is to be processed with the SBCL assembler,
    ;; not COMPILE-FILE. (Note that this doesn't make sense unless

    ;; while the cross-compiler is being built in the host ANSI Lisp.)

    ;; The correct value for the above expression - as obtained in SBCL,

    ;; to produce 0 values. In fact you can demonstrate this by actually
    ;; implementing your own "#." which conditionally returns 0 values,
    ;; and seeing that it works in any lisp including the suspect ones.

;;; Unlike xfloat-math which expresses universal truths, the perfect-hash file
;;; expresses facts about the behavior of a _particular_ SBCL revision.
;;; It was overly challenging to alter the calc-symbol-name-hash algorithm
;;; without being forced to re-run every cross-build to determine what the 32-bit
;;; inputs would be to the perfect hash generator. By storing a representations of
;;; objects that contributed to the key calculation, we can in theory recreate the
;;; perfect hash file for all relevant objects without a rebuild under every
;;; combination of architectures and features. A few difficulties:
;;; * Hashes should be emitted in base 16 because the C program wants that,
;;;   but our extended array syntax uses base 10 since it's more natural.
;;;   i..e "#A((16) (unsigned-byte 8) ...)"
;;; * Packages have to exist when the file is read, so we can't read symbols
;;;   into an architecture-specific package like sb-arm-asm.
;;;   Since symbol-name-hash is based solely on print-name, it's irrelevant what
;;;   the package is, so it's always OK to use keywords.
;;;
;;; I screwed this up multiple differerent ways when developing it.
;;; For example the symbol ADD was getting printed without a colon, and reparsed
;;; as 2781 in base 16.
;;; Finally I hit upon a solution which solves just about everything:
;;; write the identifying information as a string, which works around nonexistence
;;; of the following, among others:
;;;  - symbol SB-KERNEL:SIMD-PACK-TYPE for #-x86-64
;;;  - symbol SB-KERNEL:HANDLE-WIN32-EXCEPTION for #-win32
;;;  - package SB-APROF for #-x86-64
;;;
;;; Separating the files by N-FIXNUM-TAG-BITS works to nearly guarantee
;;; that any particular set of symbols appears once and once only, so you don't
;;; have to wonder why it appears more than once, and under what circumstance
;;; the hashes should be different for the same symbols.
;;; Unfortunately, that was too aspirational. The problem stems from NIL in a
;;; list of symbols. Since the address of NIL depends on the architecture,
;;; and not only that, the particular *FEATURES*, we might have different
;;; hashes for NIL. Like without sb-thread, there will be an alloc-region
;;; placed in static space below NIL which shifts NIL's address higher,
;;; which changes its hash.
