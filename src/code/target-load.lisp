;; One way to do it is catch all conditions and encapsulate them in
;; something new such as a LOADER-EVAL-ERROR and re-signal.

;; show the original condition and the line/col. That would unfortunately

;; Instead, printing a herald for any SERIOUS-CONDITION approximates
;; the desired behavior closely enough without printing something for warnings.

;; indicate the position of the specific subform that failed
