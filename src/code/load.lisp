;;; a string which appears at the start of a fasl file header
;;;
;;; This value is used to identify fasl files. Even though this is not
;;; declared as a constant (because ANSI Common Lisp has no facility
;;; for declaring values which are constant under EQUAL but not EQL),
;;; obviously you shouldn't mess with it lightly. If you do set a new
;;; value for some reason, keep these things in mind:
;;; * To avoid confusion with the similar but incompatible CMU CL
;;;   fasl file format, the value should not be "FASL FILE", which
;;;   is what CMU CL used for the same purpose.
;;; * Since its presence at the head of a file is used by LOAD to
;;;   decide whether a file is to be fasloaded or just loaded
;;;   ordinarily (as source), the value should be something which
;;;   can't legally appear at the head of a Lisp source file.
;;; * The value should not contain any line-terminating characters,
;;;   because they're hard to express portably and because the LOAD
;;;   code might reasonably use READ-LINE to get the value to compare
;;;   against.
