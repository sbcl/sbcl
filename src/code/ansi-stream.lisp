;;; HOW THE ANSI-STREAM STRUCTURE IS USED
;;;
;;; Many of the slots of the ANSI-STREAM structure contain functions
;;; which are called to perform some operation on the stream. Closed
;;; streams have #'CLOSED-FLAME in all of their function slots. If
;;; one side of an I/O or echo stream is closed, the whole stream is
;;; considered closed. The functions in the operation slots take
;;; arguments as follows:
;;;
;;; In:                 Stream, Eof-Errorp, Eof-Value
;;; Bin:                Stream, Eof-Errorp, Eof-Value
;;; N-Bin:              Stream, Buffer, Size-Buffer, Start, Numbytes, Eof-Errorp
;;; Cout:               Stream, Character
;;; Bout:               Stream, Integer
;;; Sout:               Stream, String, Start, End
;;; Misc:               Stream, Operation, &Optional Arg1, Arg2
;;;
;;; In order to save space, some of the less common stream operations
;;; are handled by just one function, the MISC method. This function
;;; is passed a keyword which indicates the operation to perform.
;;; The following keywords are used:
;;;  :listen            - Return the following values:
;;;                          t if any input waiting.
;;;                          :eof if at eof.
;;;                          nil if no input is available and not at eof.
;;;  :unread            - Unread the character Arg.
;;;  :close             - Do any stream specific stuff to close the stream.
;;;                       The methods are set to closed-flame by the close
;;;                       function, so that need not be done by this
;;;                       function.
;;;  :clear-input       - Clear any unread input
;;;  :finish-output,
;;;  :force-output      - Cause output to happen
;;;  :clear-output      - Clear any undone output
;;;  :element-type      - Return the type of element the stream deals with.
;;;  :line-length       - Return the length of a line of output.
;;;  :charpos           - Return current output position on the line.
;;;  :file-length       - Return the file length of a file stream.
;;;  :[gs]et-file-position  - Return or change the current position of a
;;;                       file stream.
;;;  :file-name         - Return the name of an associated file.
;;;  :interactive-p     - Is this an interactive device?
;;;
;;; In order to do almost anything useful, it is necessary to
;;; define a new type of structure that includes stream, so that the
;;; stream can have some state information.
;;;
;;; THE STREAM IN-BUFFER:
;;;
;;; The IN-BUFFER in the stream holds characters or bytes that
;;; are ready to be read by some input function. If there is any
;;; stuff in the IN-BUFFER, then the reading function can use it
;;; without calling any stream method. Any stream may put stuff in
;;; the IN-BUFFER, and may also assume that any input in the IN-BUFFER
;;; has been consumed before any in-method is called. If a text
;;; stream has in IN-BUFFER, then the first character should not be
;;; used to buffer normal input so that it is free for unreading into.
;;;
;;; When the ANSI-STREAM-IN-BUFFER slot, and its index, is only
;;; accessed by the normal stream functions, the number of function
;;; calls is halved, thus potentially doubling the speed of simple
;;; operations. If the FAST-READ-CHAR and FAST-READ-BYTE macros are
;;; used, nearly all function call overhead is removed, vastly
;;; speeding up these important operations.
