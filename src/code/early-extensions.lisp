;;; FIXME: a lot of places in the code that should use ARRAY-RANGE
;;; instead use INDEX and vice-versa, but the thing is, we have
;;; a ton of fenceposts errors all over the place regardless.
;;; CLHS glosary reference:
;;; "array total size n. the total number of elements in an array,
;;;  computed by taking the product of the dimensions of the array."
;;; and ARRAY-TOTAL-SIZE-LIMIT:
;;; "The upper exclusive bound on the array total size of an array."

;;; Consider a reduced example for the sake of argument in which
;;; ARRAY-TOTAL-SIZE-LIMIT were 21.
;;; - the largest vector would have LENGTH 20.
;;; - the largest legal index for AREF on it would be 19.
;;; - the largest legal :END on sequence functions would be 20.
;;; Nothing should allow 21. So DEFTYPE ARRAY-RANGE is wrong
;;; and must never be used for anything.
;;; Unfortunately, it's all over mb-util and enc-utf etc.
;;;
;;; *Also* INDEX is wrong, as the comment there says.
;;; To fix these and also SEQUENCE-END:
;;; - INDEX should be `(integer 0 (,1- array-dimension-limit))
;;; - ARRAY-RANGE should be `(integer 0 (,array-dimension-limit))
;;; - SEQUENCE-END (in deftypes-for-target) should be
;;;   `(OR NULL ARRAY-RANGE)
;;;
;;; A further consideration for INDEX on 64-bit machines is that
;;; if INDEX were equivalent to (UNSIGNED-BYTE n) for some 'n'
;;; then (TYPEP X 'INDEX) can combines FIXNUMP and the range test into
;;; one bit-masking test, depending on the architecture.
;;; Probably it should be (UNSIGNED-BYTE 61) except on ppc64
;;; where it would have to be (UNSIGNED-BYTE 59).

;;; A number that can represent an index into a vector, including
;;; one-past-the-end
(deftype array-range ()

;;; a type used for indexing into sequences, and for related
;;; quantities like lengths of lists and other sequences.

;;; A more correct value for the exclusive upper bound for indexing
;;; would be (1- ARRAY-DIMENSION-LIMIT) since ARRAY-DIMENSION-LIMIT is
;;; the exclusive maximum *size* of one array dimension (As specified
;;; in CLHS entries for MAKE-ARRAY and "valid array dimensions"). The
;;; current value is maintained to avoid breaking existing code that
;;; also uses that type for upper bounds on indices (e.g. sequence
;;; length).
;;;
;;; In SBCL, ARRAY-DIMENSION-LIMIT is arranged to be a little smaller
;;; than MOST-POSITIVE-FIXNUM, for implementation (see comment above
;;; ARRAY-DIMENSION-LIMIT) and efficiency reasons: staying below
;;; MOST-POSITIVE-FIXNUM lets the system know it can increment a value
;;; of type INDEX without having to worry about using a bignum to

;;; Collect some values somehow. Each of the collections specifies a
;;; bunch of things which collected during the evaluation of the body
;;; of the form. The name of the collection is used to define a local
;;; macro, a la MACROLET. Within the body, this macro will evaluate
;;; each of its arguments and collect the result, returning the
;;; current value after the collection is done. The body is evaluated
;;; as a PROGN; to get the final values when you are done, just call
;;; the collection macro with no arguments.
;;;
;;; INITIAL-VALUE is the value that the collection starts out with,
;;; which defaults to NIL. COLLECTOR is the function which does the
;;; collection. It is a function which will accept two arguments: the
;;; value to be collected and the current collection. The result of
;;; the function is made the new value for the collection. As a
;;; special-case, omitting COLLECTOR causes a list to be built in forward
;;; order. If INITIAL-VALUE is supplied for the default usage, new items
;;; will be RPLACD'd onto the end.
;;; Note that COLLECTOR may be anything that can appear in the functional
;;; position, including macros and lambdas.
;;; Also note that invocation of the collector macro for effect, i.e. other
;;; than with 0 arguments, is not prescribed to have any particular value.

;;;; hash cache utility

;;; Define a hash cache that associates some number of argument values
;;; with a result value. The TEST-FUNCTION paired with each ARG-NAME
;;; is used to compare the value for that arg in a cache entry with a
;;; supplied arg. The TEST-FUNCTION must not error when passed NIL as
;;; its first arg, but need not return any particular value.
;;; TEST-FUNCTION may be any thing that can be placed in CAR position.
;;;
;;; This code used to store all the arguments / return values directly
;;; in the cache vector. This was both interrupt- and thread-unsafe, since
;;; it was possible that *-CACHE-ENTER would scribble over a region of the
;;; cache vector which *-CACHE-LOOKUP had only partially processed. Instead
;;; we now store the contents of each cache bucket as a separate array, which
;;; is stored in the appropriate cell in the cache vector. A new bucket array
;;; is created every time *-CACHE-ENTER is called, and the old ones are never
;;; modified. This means that *-CACHE-LOOKUP will always work with a set
;;; of consistent data. The overhead caused by consing new buckets seems to
;;; be insignificant on the grand scale of things. -- JES, 2006-11-02
;;;
;;; NAME is used to define these functions:
;;; <name>-CACHE-LOOKUP Arg*
;;;   See whether there is an entry for the specified ARGs in the
;;;   cache. If not present, the :DEFAULT keyword (default NIL)
;;;   determines the result(s).
;;; <name>-CACHE-ENTER Arg* Value*
;;;   Encache the association of the specified args with VALUE.
;;; <name>-CACHE-CLEAR
;;;   Reinitialize the cache, invalidating all entries and allowing
;;;   the arguments and result values to be GC'd.
;;;
;;; These other keywords are defined:
;;; :HASH-BITS <n>
;;;   The size of the cache as a power of 2.
;;; :HASH-FUNCTION function
;;;   Some thing that can be placed in CAR position which will compute
;;;   a fixnum with at least (* 2 <hash-bits>) of information in it.
;;; :VALUES <n>
;;;   the number of return values cached for each function call
