;;;; This file contains Unix support that SBCL needs to implement
;;;; itself. It's derived from Peter Van Eynde's unix-glibc2.lisp for
;;;; CMU CL, which was derived from CMU CL unix.lisp 1.56. But those
;;;; files aspired to be complete Unix interfaces exported to the end
;;;; user, while this file aims to be as simple as possible and is not
;;;; intended for the end user.
;;;;
;;;; FIXME: The old CMU CL unix.lisp code was implemented as hand
;;;; transcriptions from Unix headers into Lisp. It appears that this was as
;;;; unmaintainable in practice as you'd expect in theory, so I really really
;;;; don't want to do that. It'd be good to implement the various system calls
;;;; as C code implemented using the Unix header files, and have their
;;;; interface back to SBCL code be characterized by things like "32-bit-wide
;;;; int" which are already in the interface between the runtime
;;;; executable and the SBCL lisp code.

;;;; This software is part of the SBCL system. See the README file for
;;;; more information.
;;;;
;;;; This software is derived from the CMU CL system, which was
;;;; written at Carnegie Mellon University and released into the

;;;; provided with absolutely no warranty. See the COPYING and CREDITS
