First argument of a CAS function is the expected old value, and the second

to the implementor of a CAS function to ensure its atomicity.

  "Atomically stores NEW in PLACE if OLD matches the current value of PLACE.
Two values are considered to match if they are EQ. Returns the previous value
of PLACE: if the returned value is EQ to OLD, the swap was carried out.

PLACE must be an CAS-able place. Built-in CAS-able places are accessor forms
whose CAR is one of the following:

 CAR, CDR, FIRST, REST, SVREF, SYMBOL-PLIST, SYMBOL-VALUE, SLOT-VALUE
 SB-MOP:STANDARD-INSTANCE-ACCESS, SB-MOP:FUNCALLABLE-STANDARD-INSTANCE-ACCESS,

or the name of a DEFSTRUCT created accessor for a slot whose storage type
is not raw. (Refer to the the \"Efficiency\" chapter of the manual
for the list of raw slot types.  Future extensions to this macro may allow
it to work on some raw slot types.)

In case of SLOT-VALUE, if the slot is unbound, SLOT-UNBOUND is called unless
OLD is EQ to SB-PCL:+SLOT-UNBOUND+ in which case SB-PCL:+SLOT-UNBOUND+ is
returned and NEW is assigned to the slot. Additionally, the results are
unspecified if there is an applicable method on either
SB-MOP:SLOT-VALUE-USING-CLASS, (SETF SB-MOP:SLOT-VALUE-USING-CLASS), or
SB-MOP:SLOT-BOUNDP-USING-CLASS.

Additionally, the PLACE can be a anything for which a CAS-function has
been defined. (See SB-EXT:CAS for more information.)
