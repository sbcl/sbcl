;;; This is a list of conses (fun-end-cookie . condition-satisfied),

;;; the new end-cookie and whether the trace condition was satisfied.
;;; We must save the trace condition so that the after breakpoint
;;; knows whether to print. The length of this list tells us the
;;; indentation to use for printing TRACE messages.
;;;
;;; This list also helps us synchronize the TRACE facility dynamically
;;; for detecting non-local flow of control. Whenever execution hits a
;;; :FUN-END breakpoint used for TRACE'ing, we look for the
;;; FUN-END-COOKIE at the top of *TRACED-ENTRIES*. If it is not
;;; there, we discard any entries that come before our cookie.
;;;
;;; When we trace using encapsulation, we bind this variable and add
;;; (NIL . CONDITION-SATISFIED), so a NIL "cookie" marks an
;;; encapsulated tracing.

  "TRACE {Option Global-Value}* {Name {Option Value}*}*

TRACE is a debugging tool that provides information when specified
functions are called. In its simplest form:

       (TRACE NAME-1 NAME-2 ...)

The NAMEs are not evaluated. Each may be a symbol, denoting an
individual function, or a string, denoting all functions fbound to
symbols whose home package is the package with the given name.

Options allow modification of the default behavior. Each option is a
pair of an option keyword and a value form. Global options are
specified before the first name, and affect all functions traced by a
given use of TRACE. Options may also be interspersed with function
names, in which case they act as local options, only affecting tracing
of the immediately preceding function name. Local options override
global options.

By default, TRACE causes a printout on *TRACE-OUTPUT* each time that
one of the named functions is entered or returns. (This is the basic,
ANSI Common Lisp behavior of TRACE.) As an SBCL extension, the
:REPORT SB-EXT:PROFILE option can be used to instead cause information
to be silently recorded to be inspected later using the SB-EXT:PROFILE
function.

The following options are defined:

   :REPORT Report-Type
       If Report-Type is TRACE (the default) then information is reported
       by printing immediately. If Report-Type is SB-EXT:PROFILE, information
       is recorded for later summary by calls to SB-EXT:PROFILE. If
       Report-Type is NIL, then the only effect of the trace is to execute
       other options (e.g. PRINT or BREAK).

   :CONDITION Form
   :CONDITION-AFTER Form
   :CONDITION-ALL Form
       If :CONDITION is specified, then TRACE does nothing unless Form
       evaluates to true at the time of the call. :CONDITION-AFTER is
       similar, but suppresses the initial printout, and is tested when the
       function returns. :CONDITION-ALL tries both before and after.
       This option is not supported with :REPORT PROFILE.

   :BREAK Form
   :BREAK-AFTER Form
   :BREAK-ALL Form
       If specified, and Form evaluates to true, then the debugger is invoked
       at the start of the function, at the end of the function, or both,
       according to the respective option.

   :PRINT Form
   :PRINT-AFTER Form
   :PRINT-ALL Form
       In addition to the usual printout, the result of evaluating Form is
       printed at the start of the function, at the end of the function, or
       both, according to the respective option. Multiple print options cause
       multiple values to be printed.

   :WHEREIN Names
       If specified, Names is a function name or list of names. TRACE does
       nothing unless a call to one of those functions encloses the call to
       this function (i.e. it would appear in a backtrace.)  Anonymous
       functions have string names like \"DEFUN FOO\". This option is not
       supported with :REPORT PROFILE.

   :ENCAPSULATE {:DEFAULT | T | NIL}
       If T, the tracing is done via encapsulation (redefining the function
       name) rather than by modifying the function. :DEFAULT is the default,
       and means to use encapsulation for interpreted functions and funcallable
       instances, breakpoints otherwise. When encapsulation is used, forms are
       *not* evaluated in the function's lexical environment, but SB-DEBUG:ARG
       can still be used.

   :METHODS {T | NIL}
       If T, any function argument naming a generic function will have its
       methods traced in addition to the generic function itself.

   :FUNCTION Function-Form
       This is a not really an option, but rather another way of specifying
       what function to trace. The Function-Form is evaluated immediately,
       and the resulting function is instrumented, i.e. traced or profiled
       as specified in REPORT.

:CONDITION, :BREAK and :PRINT forms are evaluated in a context which
mocks up the lexical environment of the called function, so that
SB-DEBUG:VAR and SB-DEBUG:ARG can be used. The -AFTER and -ALL forms
are evaluated in the null environment."
