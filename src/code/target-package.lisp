;;;;   Within one package, any particular name can refer to at most one
;;;;   symbol. A name conflict is said to occur when there would be more
;;;;   than one candidate symbol. Any time a name conflict is about to
;;;;   occur, a correctable error is signaled.

;;;; ...this could still use work, but the basic idea is:
;;;;
;;;; *PACKAGE-GRAPH-LOCK* is held via WITH-PACKAGE-GRAPH while working on
;;;; package graph, including package -> package links, and interning and
;;;; uninterning symbols.
;;;;
;;;; Lock on *ALL-PACKAGES* is held via WITH-PACKAGE-NAMES while
;;;; frobbing name -> package associations.
;;;;
;;;; There should be no deadlocks due to ordering issues between these two, as
;;;; the latter is only held over operations guaranteed to terminate in finite
;;;; time.
;;;;
;;;; Errors may be signalled while holding on to the *PACKAGE-GRAPH-LOCK*,
;;;; which can still lead to pretty damned inconvenient situations -- but
;;;; since FIND-PACKAGE, FIND-SYMBOL from other threads isn't blocked by this,
;;;; the situation isn't *quite* hopeless.
;;;;
;;;; A better long-term solution seems to be in splitting the granularity of
;;;; the *PACKAGE-GRAPH-LOCK* down: for interning a per-package lock should be
;;;; sufficient, though interaction between parallel intern and use-package
;;;; needs to be considered with some care.
