;;;; FUNCTION and VALUES types
;;;;
;;;; Pretty much all of the general type operations are illegal on
;;;; VALUES types, since we can't discriminate using them, do
;;;; SUBTYPEP, etc. FUNCTION types are acceptable to the normal type
;;;; operations, but are generally considered to be equivalent to
;;;; FUNCTION. These really aren't true types in any type theoretic
;;;; sense, but we still parse them into CTYPE structures for two
;;;; reasons:

;;;; -- Parsing and unparsing work the same way, and indeed we can't
;;;;    tell whether a type is a function or values type without
;;;;    parsing it.
;;;; -- Many of the places that can be annotated with real types can
;;;;    also be annotated with function or values types.

;;; Take the numeric bound X and convert it into something that can be
;;; used as a bound in a numeric type with the specified CLASS and
;;; FORMAT. If UP-P is true, then we round up as needed, otherwise we
;;; round down. UP-P true implies that X is a lower bound, i.e. (N) > N.
;;;
;;; This is used by NUMERIC-TYPE-INTERSECTION to mash the bound into
;;; the appropriate type number. X may only be a float when CLASS is
;;; FLOAT.
;;;
;;; ### Note: it is possible for the coercion to a float to overflow
;;; or underflow. This happens when the bound doesn't fit in the
;;; specified format. In this case, we should really return the
;;; appropriate {Most | Least}-{Positive | Negative}-XXX-Float float
;;; of desired format. But these conditions aren't currently signalled
;;; in any useful way.
;;;
;;; Also, when converting an open rational bound into a float we
;;; should probably convert it to a closed bound of the closest float
;;; in the specified format. KLUDGE: In general, open float bounds are
;;; screwed up. -- (comment from original CMU CL)

;;; The following function is a generic driver for approximating
;;; set-valued functions over types.  Putting this here because it'll
;;; probably be useful for a lot of type analyses.
;;;
;;; Let f be a function from values of type X to Y, e.g., ARRAY-RANK.
;;;
;;; We compute an over or under-approximation of the set
;;;
;;;  F(TYPE) = { f(x) : x in TYPE /\ x in X } \subseteq Y
;;;
;;; via set-valued approximations of f, OVER and UNDER.
;;;
;;; These functions must have the property that
;;;   Forall TYPE, OVER(TYPE) \superseteq F(TYPE) and
;;;   Forall TYPE, UNDER(TYPE) \subseteq F(TYPE)
;;;
;;; The driver is also parameterised over the finite set
;;; representation.
;;;
;;; Union, intersection and difference are binary functions to compute
;;; set union, intersection and difference.  Top and bottom are the
;;; concrete representations for the universe and empty sets; we never
;;; call the set functions on top or bottom, so it's safe to use
;;; special values there.
;;;
;;; Arguments:
;;;
;;;  TYPE: the ctype for which we wish to approximate F(TYPE)
;;;  OVERAPPROXIMATE: true if we wish to overapproximate, nil otherwise.
;;;     You usually want T.
;;;  UNION/INTERSECTION/DIFFERENCE: implementations of finite set operations.
;;;     Conform to cl::(union/intersection/set-difference).  Passing NIL will
;;;     disable some cleverness and result in quicker computation of coarser
;;;     approximations.  However, passing difference without union and intersection
;;;     will probably not end well.
;;;  TOP/BOTTOM: concrete representation of the universe and empty set.  Finite
;;;     set operations are never called on TOP/BOTTOM, so it's safe to use special
;;;     values there.
;;;  OVER/UNDER: the set-valued approximations of F.
;;;
;;; Implementation details.
;;;
;;; It's a straightforward walk down the type.
;;; Union types -> take the union of children, intersection ->
;;; intersect.  There is some complication for negation types: we must
;;; not only negate the result, but also flip from overapproximating
;;; to underapproximating in the children (or vice versa).
;;;
;;; We represent sets as a pair of (negate-p finite-set) in order to
;;; support negation types.
