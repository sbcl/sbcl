COMPARE-AND-SWAP, and must initially hold NIL.

WITH-CAS-LOCK is suitable mostly when the critical section needing protection
is very small, and cost of allocating a separate lock object would be
prohibitive. While it is the most lightweight locking constructed offered by
SBCL, it is also the least scalable if the section is heavily contested or
long.

the mutex is not immediately available, sleep until it is available.

If TIMEOUT is given, it specifies a relative timeout, in seconds, on how long
GRAB-MUTEX should try to acquire the lock in the contested case.

If GRAB-MUTEX returns T, the lock acquisition was successful. In case of WAITP
being NIL, or an expired TIMEOUT, GRAB-MUTEX may also return NIL which denotes
that GRAB-MUTEX did -not- acquire the lock.

Notes:

  - GRAB-MUTEX is not interrupt safe. The correct way to call it is:

      (WITHOUT-INTERRUPTS
        ...
        (ALLOW-WITH-INTERRUPTS (GRAB-MUTEX ...))
        ...)

    WITHOUT-INTERRUPTS is necessary to avoid an interrupt unwinding the call
    while the mutex is in an inconsistent state while ALLOW-WITH-INTERRUPTS
    allows the call to be interrupted from sleep.

  - (GRAB-MUTEX <mutex> :timeout 0.0) differs from
    (GRAB-MUTEX <mutex> :waitp nil) in that the former may signal a
    DEADLINE-TIMEOUT if the global deadline was due already on entering
    GRAB-MUTEX.

    The exact interplay of GRAB-MUTEX and deadlines are reserved to change in
    future versions.

  - It is recommended that you use WITH-MUTEX instead of calling GRAB-MUTEX
    directly.

(defun interrupt-thread (thread function)
  #!+sb-doc
  "Interrupt THREAD and make it run FUNCTION.

The interrupt is asynchronous, and can occur anywhere with the exception of
sections protected using SB-SYS:WITHOUT-INTERRUPTS.

FUNCTION is called with interrupts disabled, under
SB-SYS:ALLOW-WITH-INTERRUPTS. Since functions such as GRAB-MUTEX may try to
enable interrupts internally, in most cases FUNCTION should either enter
SB-SYS:WITH-INTERRUPTS to allow nested interrupts, or
SB-SYS:WITHOUT-INTERRUPTS to prevent them completely.

When a thread receives multiple interrupts, they are executed in the order
they were sent -- first in, first out.

This means that a great degree of care is required to use INTERRUPT-THREAD
safely and sanely in a production environment. The general recommendation is
to limit uses of INTERRUPT-THREAD for interactive debugging, banning it
entirely from production environments -- it is simply exceedingly hard to use
correctly.

With those caveats in mind, what you need to know when using it:

 * If calling FUNCTION causes a non-local transfer of control (ie. an
   unwind), all normal cleanup forms will be executed.

   However, if the interrupt occurs during cleanup forms of an UNWIND-PROTECT,
   it is just as if that had happened due to a regular GO, THROW, or
   RETURN-FROM: the interrupted cleanup form and those following it in the
   same UNWIND-PROTECT do not get executed.

   SBCL tries to keep its own internals asynch-unwind-safe, but this is
   frankly an unreasonable expectation for third party libraries, especially
   given that asynch-unwind-safety does not compose: a function calling
   only asynch-unwind-safe function isn't automatically asynch-unwind-safe.

   This means that in order for an asynch unwind to be safe, the entire
   callstack at the point of interruption needs to be asynch-unwind-safe.

 * In addition to asynch-unwind-safety you must consider the issue of
   reentrancy. INTERRUPT-THREAD can cause function that are never normally
   called recursively to be re-entered during their dynamic contour,
   which may cause them to misbehave. (Consider binding of special variables,
   values of global variables, etc.)

Take together, these two restrict the \"safe\" things to do using
INTERRUPT-THREAD to a fairly minimal set. One useful one -- exclusively for
interactive development use is using it to force entry to debugger to inspect
the state of a thread:

  (interrupt-thread thread #'break)

might miss calling RELEASE-FOO despite GET-FOO having returned true if
the interrupt occurs inside the cleanup clause, eg. during execution
of RELEASE-FOO.

Thus, in order to write an asynch unwind safe UNWIND-PROTECT you need
to use WITHOUT-INTERRUPTS:

  (let (foo)
    (sb-sys:without-interrupts
      (unwind-protect
          (progn
            (setf foo (sb-sys:allow-with-interrupts
                        (get-foo)))
            (sb-sys:with-local-interrupts
              (work-on-foo foo)))
       (when foo
         (release-foo foo)))))

Since most libraries using UNWIND-PROTECT do not do this, you should never
assume that unknown code can safely be terminated using TERMINATE-THREAD."
