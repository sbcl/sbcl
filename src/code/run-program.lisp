;;;; hacking the Unix environment
;;;;
;;;; In the original CMU CL code that LOAD-FOREIGN is derived from, the
;;;; Unix environment (as in "man environ") was represented as an
;;;; alist from keywords to strings, so that e.g. the Unix environment
;;;;   "SHELL=/bin/bash" "HOME=/root" "PAGER=less"
;;;; was represented as
;;;;   ((:SHELL . "/bin/bash") (:HOME . "/root") (:PAGER "less"))
;;;; This had a few problems in principle: the mapping into
;;;; keyword symbols smashed the case of environment
;;;; variables, and the whole mapping depended on the presence of
;;;; #\= characters in the environment strings. In practice these
;;;; problems weren't hugely important, since conventionally environment
;;;; variables are uppercase strings followed by #\= followed by
;;;; arbitrary data. However, since it's so manifestly not The Right
;;;; Thing to make code which breaks unnecessarily on input which
;;;; doesn't follow what is, after all, only a tradition, we've switched
;;;; formats in SBCL, so that the fundamental environment list
;;;; is just a list of strings, with a one-to-one-correspondence
;;;; to the C-level representation. I.e., in the example above,
;;;; the SBCL representation is
;;;;   '("SHELL=/bin/bash" "HOME=/root" "PAGER=less")
;;;; CMU CL's implementation is currently supported to help with porting.
;;;;
;;;; It's not obvious that this code belongs here (instead of e.g. in
;;;; unix.lisp), since it has only a weak logical connection with
;;;; RUN-PROGRAM. However, physically it's convenient to put it here.
;;;; It's not needed at cold init, so we *can* put it in this
;;;; warm-loaded file. And by putting it in this warm-loaded file, we
;;;; make it easy for it to get to the C-level 'environ' variable.
;;;; which (at least in sbcl-0.6.10 on Red Hat Linux 6.2) is not
;;;; visible at GENESIS time.

  "RUN-PROGRAM creates a new process specified by PROGRAM.
ARGS is a list of strings to be passed literally to the new program.
In POSIX environments, this list becomes the array supplied as the second
parameter to the execv() or execvp() system call, each list element becoming
one array element. The strings should not contain shell escaping, as there is
no shell involvement. Further note that while conventionally the process
receives its own pathname in argv[0], that is automatic, and the 0th string
should not be present in ARGS.

The program arguments and the environment are encoded using the
default external format for streams.

RUN-PROGRAM will return a PROCESS structure. See the CMU Common Lisp
Users Manual for details about the PROCESS structure.

   Notes about Unix environments (as in the :ENVIRONMENT and :ENV args):

   - The SBCL implementation of RUN-PROGRAM, like Perl and many other
     programs, but unlike the original CMU CL implementation, copies
     the Unix environment by default.
   - Running Unix programs from a setuid process, or in any other
     situation where the Unix environment is under the control of someone
     else, is a mother lode of security problems. If you are contemplating
     doing this, read about it first. (The Perl community has a lot of good
     documentation about this and other security issues in script-like
     programs.)

   The &KEY arguments have the following meanings:
   :ENVIRONMENT
      a list of STRINGs describing the new Unix environment
      (as in \"man environ\"). The default is to copy the environment of
      the current process.
   :ENV
      an alternative lossy representation of the new Unix environment,
      for compatibility with CMU CL
   :SEARCH
      Look for PROGRAM in each of the directories in the child's $PATH
      environment variable.  Otherwise an absolute pathname is required.
   :WAIT
      If non-NIL (default), wait until the created process finishes.  If
      NIL, continue running Lisp until the program finishes.
   :PTY (not supported on win32)
      Either T, NIL, or a stream.  Unless NIL, the subprocess is established
      under a PTY.  If :pty is a stream, all output to this pty is sent to
      this stream, otherwise the PROCESS-PTY slot is filled in with a stream
      connected to pty that can read output and write input.
   :INPUT
      Either T, NIL, a pathname, a stream, or :STREAM.
      T: the standard input for the current process is inherited.
      NIL: /dev/null (nul on win32) is used.
      pathname: the specified file is used.
      stream: all the input is read from that stream and sent to the
      subprocess.
      :STREAM: the PROCESS-INPUT slot is filled in with a stream that sends
      its output to the process.
      Defaults to NIL.
   :IF-INPUT-DOES-NOT-EXIST (when :INPUT is the name of a file)
      can be one of:
         :ERROR to generate an error
         :CREATE to create an empty file
         NIL (the default) to return NIL from RUN-PROGRAM
   :OUTPUT
      Either T, NIL, a pathname, a stream, or :STREAM.
      T: the standard output for the current process is inherited.
      NIL: /dev/null (nul on win32) is used.
      pathname: the specified file is used.
      stream: all the output from the process is written to this stream.
      :STREAM: the PROCESS-OUTPUT slot is filled in with a stream that can be
      read to get the output.
      Defaults to NIL.
   :ERROR
      Same as :OUTPUT, additionally accepts :OUTPUT, making all error
      output routed to the same place as normal output.
      Defaults to :OUTPUT.
   :IF-OUTPUT-EXISTS (when :OUTPUT is the name of a file)
      can be one of:
         :ERROR (the default) to generate an error
         :SUPERSEDE to supersede the file with output from the program
         :APPEND to append output from the program to the file
         NIL to return NIL from RUN-PROGRAM, without doing anything
   :IF-ERROR-EXISTS
      Same as :IF-OUTPUT-EXISTS, controlling :ERROR output to files.
      Ignored when :ERROR :OUTPUT.
      Defaults to :ERROR.
   :STATUS-HOOK
      This is a function the system calls whenever the status of the
      process changes.  The function takes the process as an argument.
   :EXTERNAL-FORMAT
      The external-format to use for :INPUT, :OUTPUT, and :ERROR :STREAMs.
   :DIRECTORY
      Specifies the directory in which the program should be run.
      NIL (the default) means the directory is unchanged.

   :PRESERVE-FDS
      A sequence of file descriptors which should remain open in the child
      process.

   Windows specific options:
   :ESCAPE-ARGUMENTS (default T)
      Controls escaping of the arguments passed to CreateProcess.
   :WINDOW (default NIL)
      When NIL, the subprocess decides how it will display its window. The
      following options control how the subprocess window should be displayed:
      :HIDE, :SHOW-NORMAL, :SHOW-MAXIMIZED, :SHOW-MINIMIZED, :SHOW-NO-ACTIVATE,
      :SHOW-MIN-NO-ACTIVE, :SHOW-NA.
      Note: console application subprocesses may or may not display a console
      window depending on whether the SBCL runtime is itself a console or GUI
      application. Invoke CMD /C START to consistently display a console window
      or use the :WINDOW :HIDE option to consistently hide the console window."
