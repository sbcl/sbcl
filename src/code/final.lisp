;;; If loading a weak ref requires a read barrier (as per #+weak-vector-readbarrier)
;;; then the finalizer table based on a split-ordered-list does not work as-is.
;;; It could be made to via a few approaches of varying levels of difficulty:
;;; * make the split-ordered-list contains keys which are weak pointers
;;;   so that _only_ SB-VM:WEAK-POINTER-WIDETAG can weakly reference things.
;;;   Also make the solist hash on the thing inside the weak-pointer
;;;   rather than the address of the weak pointer. Similarly, detect
;;;   address movement if the thing inside the weak pointer moves.
;;; * turn SO-NODE into something that is not STRUCURE-OBJECT so that at least
;;;   we can't accidentally use %INSTANCE-REF to circumvent a read barrier.
;;; * put a read barrier on SO-NODE-KEY, but only for the finalizer table.
;;;   %INSTANCE-REF with an index that is (GET-DSD-INDEX SO-DATA-NODE SO-KEY)
;;;   has to not only re-tag an untagged pointer, but also ensure that a concurrent
;;;   sweep phase isn't in the midst of smashing weak pointers whose referent is
;;;   dead. But there's no good way to do that on arbitrary structure-object slots.
;;;   The vop translator for instance-ref could potentially do the right thing on
;;;   a known structure type, but I would worry that interpreted instance-ref would
;;;   either do the wrong thing, or pessimize _every_ call. And even then,
;;;   compile-time instance-ref could also do the wrong thing unless we make
;;;   the general case of instance-ref assume the worst, namely that it has to
;;;   check whether the slot is weak.
;;; Though the first is conceptually easy, I don't feel like doing anything yet.
;;; Therefore, if #+weak-vector-readbarrier is enabled, simply fall back upon the
;;; old alist of (weakptr . action) which should be adequate for the time being.

;;; as a "weak" compare-and-swap if we had such thing. When spurious failure
;;; occurs, we're already inside a loop, and will retry the CAS anyway.

;;; Rehashing due to key movement is synchronized by the finalizer-lock.
;;; When adding or canceling a finalizer, we first have to handle the possibility
;;; that GC moved the object of interest from FINALIZER-STORE into FINALIZER-REHASHLIST.
;;; All those keys have to be re-inserted, otherwise there's no way to know the
;;; disposition of a CANCEL-FINALIZATION request.
;;; Even if users are always careful never to operate on one object from two different
;;; threads - so they never introduce a data race between FINALIZE and CANCEL -
;;; we could, if rehashing in multiple threads, create a data race between a user
;;; trying to CANCEL, and a different thread processing the rehashlist and inserting
;;; the canceled key. To prevent that, only one thread will rehash if keys moved.
;;;
;;; Note: Other keys could appear in the FINALIZER-REHASHLIST _after_ we test
;;; whether it is equal to +TAIL+.  This can occur because we're not synchronized
;;; with GC. But that's OK - we pin OBJECT before entering the mutex scope,
;;; therefore it can not move to the rehashlist. So upon seeing the alleged end of the
;;; rehashlist, OBJECT can not be in it. But it could actually be in the FINALIZER-STORE
;;; already because if two threads observe *FINALIZER-REHASHLIST* to be non-nil, they'll
;;; both try to rehash, and presumably one will have no work to do. (Unless GC moves
;;; even more things after the first thread to rehash leaves its mutex scope)

;;; This is a display produced by annotating parts of gc-common.c and
;;; interrupt.c with each thread's output in its own column.
;;; The main thread is on the right.

;;; This output shows that if the finalizer thread calls a function that
;;; triggers a GC, the interrupt nesting depth can grow without limit.
;;; The finalizer thread does not have to be a memory hog - it just has
;;; to be unlucky enough to be the thread that triggers the collection.
;;; _Any_ thread can bring the GC trigger up to the threshold,
;;; and as long as the finalizer thread is the one to cross the
;;; the threshold, it is tasked with triggering the next scan
;;; of finalizers, but it MUST NOT do so recursively.
;;;
;;; The same thing can happen without using a finalizer thread,
;;; but it's actually easier to understand the output this way.
