;;;; Encode and decode universal times.

;;; In August 2003, work was done in this file for more plausible
;;; timezone handling after the unix timezone database runs out in
;;; 2038.  We assume that timezone rules are trending sane rather than
;;; insane, so for all years after the end of time_t we apply the
;;; rules for 2035/2036 instead of the actual date asked for.  Making
;;; the same assumption about the early 1900s would be less
;;; reasonable, however, so please note that we're still broken for
;;; local time between 1900-1-1 and 1901-12-13

;;; It should be noted that 64 bit machines don't actually fix this
;;; problem, at least as of 2003, because the Unix zonefiles are
;;; specified in terms of 32 bit fields even on, say, the Alpha.  So,
;;; references to the range of time_t elsewhere in this file should
;;; rightly be read as shorthand for the range of an signed 32 bit
;;; number of seconds since 1970-01-01

;;; I'm obliged to Erik Naggum's "Long, Painful History of Time" paper
;;; <http://naggum.no/lugm-time.html> for the choice of epoch here.
;;; By starting the year in March, we avoid having to test the month
;;; whenever deciding whether to account for a leap day.  2000 is
;;; especially special, because it's disvisible by 400, hence the
;;; start of a 400 year leap year cycle

;;; If a universal-time is after time_t runs out, we find its offset
;;; from 1st March of whichever year it falls in, then add that to
;;; 2035-3-1.  This date has two relevant properties: (1) somewhere
;;; near the end of time_t, and (2) preceding a leap year.  Thus a
;;; date which is e.g. 365.5 days from March 1st in its year will be
;;; treated for timezone lookup as if it were Feb 29th 2036

;;; This epoch is used only for fixing the timezones-outside-time_t
;;; problem.  Someday it would be nice to come back to this code and
;;; see if the rest of the file and its references to Spice Lisp
;;; history (Perq time base?) could be cleaned up any on this basis.
;;; -- dan, 2003-08-08

;;; In order to accomodate universal times between January 1st 1900
;;; and sometime on December 13th 1901, I'm doing the same calculation
;;; as described above in order to handle dates in that interval, by
;;; normalizing them to March 1st 1903, which shares the same special
;;; properties described above (except for the 400-year property, but
;;; this isn't an issue for the limited range we need to handle).

;;; One open issue is whether to pass UNIX a 64-bit time_t value on
;;; 64-bit platforms. I don't know if time_t is always 64-bit on those
;;; platforms, and looking at this file reveals a scary amount of
;;; literal 31 and 32s.
;;; -- bem, 2005-08-09

;;; Subtract from the returned Internal-Time to get the universal
;;; time. The offset between our time base and the Perq one is 2145
