/* Consing an SB-THREAD:THREAD instance from C for each thread would be ideal because:
 * 1. Generally the representation of a thread that *MUST* exist is the Lisp object,
 *    despite the backing memory being freed. Unfortunately, the main thread violated
 *    this during startup, as it has backing memory without a thread_instance.
 * 2. In a new yieldpoint implementation (WIP), some logic requires a pthread mutex
 *    (or Windows equivalent) in each 'struct thread' for mediating access.
 *    This can cause a lock ordering problem (i.e. deadlock) if, to manipulate a thread
 *    from Lisp, both the Lisp mutex and C mutex are needed. There should be exactly one
 *    lock per thread, and it belongs to the thread manifestation that always exists.
 *    This poses difficulties if the main thread's instance is missing for even a moment.
 * 3. Possibly we could eliminate the duplicated os_thread slot,
 *    which is a source of confusion if nothing else.
