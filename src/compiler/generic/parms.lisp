#!+gencgc
;; Define START/END constants for GENCGC spaces.
;; Assumptions:
;;     We only need very small read-only and static spaces, because
;;     gencgc does not purify any more.  We can count on being able to
;;     allocate them with roughly the same size, and next to each other.
;;
;;     There is one page of unmapped buffer between them for good measure.
;;
;;     The linkage table (if enabled) can be treated the same way.
;;
;;     Dynamic space traditionally sits elsewhere, so has its own
;;     parameter.  But if not specified, it is allocated right after
;;     the other spaces (used on Windows/x86).
;;
;;     The safepoint page (if enabled) is to be allocated immediately
;;     prior to static page.  For x86(-64) this would not matter, because
;;     they can only reference it using an absolute fixup anyway, but
;;     for RISC platforms we can (and must) do better.
;;
;;     The safepoint page needs to be small enough that the offset from
;;     static space is immediate, e.g. >= -2^12 for SPARC.  #x1000 works
;;     for almost all platforms, but is too small to make VirtualProtect
;;     happy -- hence the need for an extra `alignment' configuration
;;     option below, which parms.lisp can set to #x10000 on Windows.
;;
;; Cosmetic problem:
;;
;;     In the interest of readability, &KEY would be much nicer than
;;     &OPTIONAL.  But is it possible to use keyword arguments to
;;     DEF!MACRO?
