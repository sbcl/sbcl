;;     allocate them with roughly the same size, and next to each other.
;;
;;     The linkage table (if enabled) can be treated the same way.
;;

;;     the other spaces (used on Windows/x86).
;;
;;     The safepoint page (if enabled) is to be allocated immediately

;;; than fixnum inputs. To call lisp the general function, we need a fixed address
;;; holding its entry point, namely the static-fdefn. While we do allow boxed constants
;;; in the assembly code header now, it's not general enough for calling.
;;;
;;; Additionally, in the distant-but-memorable past there were things known

;;; important functions such as LENGTH and %COERCE-CALLABLE-TO-FUN.
;;; (Surprisingly, LCM and GCD were deemed important enough to merit special status)
;;; The main purpose of a static function was to call it without reference to
;;; an #<fdefn>. But those "static functions" were unusual in that they bypassed
;;; the normal call convention. They were all deleted in the following change series:
;;;      d65b9573423610589319889a0eeb31c5501862bf Remove define-static-fun on MIPS.
;;;      f39d1846e90ed20cd529ce2fb701de9ad0293f59 Remove define-static-fun on SPARC.

;;; The corresponding static-fdefns should have been deleted with them.
;;;
;;; However, it is still true that some functions are of such importance
;;; that calling them with 1 fewer instruction and 1 fewer code header constant
