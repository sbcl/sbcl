;;; as a call with that many args would consume 8 GB of stack,

;;; COMPILE-FILE usually puts all nontoplevel code in immobile space, but COMPILE
;;; offers a choice. Because the immobile space GC does not run often enough (yet),
;;; COMPILE usually places code in the dynamic space managed by our copying GC.
;;; Change this variable if your application always demands immobile code.
;;; In particular, ELF cores shrink the immobile code space down to just enough
;;; to contain all code, plus about 1/2 MiB of spare, which means that you can't
;;; subsequently compile a whole lot into immobile space.
;;; The value is changed to :AUTO in make-target-2-load.lisp which suppresses
;;; codegen optimizations for immobile space, but nonetheless prefers to allocate
;;; the code there, falling back to dynamic space if there is no room left.
