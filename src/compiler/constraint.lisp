;;; TODO:

;;; -- MV-BIND, :ASSIGNMENT
;;;
;;; Note: The functions in this file that accept constraint sets are
;;; actually receiving the constraint sets associated with nodes,
;;; blocks, and lambda-vars.  It might be make CP easier to understand
;;; and work on if these functions traded in nodes, blocks, and
;;; lambda-vars directly.

;;; Problems:
;;;
;;; -- Constraint propagation badly interacts with bottom-up type
;;; inference. Consider
;;;
;;; (defun foo (n &aux (i 42))
;;;   (declare (optimize speed))
;;;   (declare (fixnum n)
;;;            #+nil (type (integer 0) i))
;;;   (tagbody
;;;      (setq i 0)
;;;    :loop
;;;      (when (>= i n) (go :exit))
;;;      (setq i (1+ i))
;;;      (go :loop)
;;;    :exit))
;;;
;;; In this case CP cannot even infer that I is of class INTEGER.
;;;
;;; -- In the above example if we place the check after SETQ, CP will
;;; fail to infer (< I FIXNUM): it does not understand that this
;;; constraint follows from (TYPEP I (INTEGER 0 0)).

;;; Historically, CMUCL and SBCL have used a sparse set implementation
;;; for which most operations are O(n) (see sset.lisp), but at the
;;; cost of at least a full word of pointer for each constraint set
;;; element.  Using bit-vectors instead of pointer structures saves a
;;; lot of space and thus GC time (particularly on 64-bit machines),
;;; and saves time on copy, union, intersection, and difference
;;; operations; but makes iteration slower.  Circa September 2008,
;;; switching to bit-vectors gave a modest (5-10%) improvement in real
;;; compile time for most Lisp systems, and as much as 20-30% for some
;;; particularly CP-dependent systems.

;;; It's bad to leave commented code in files, but if some clever
;;; person comes along and makes SSETs better than bit-vectors as sets
;;; for constraint propagation, or if bit-vectors on some XC host
;;; really lose compared to SSETs, here's the conset API as a wrapper
;;; around SSETs:

;;; be EQL to a given variable (including itself), via DO-EQL-VARS.
;;;
;;; It also has to iterate through constraints that are inherited by EQL variables
;;; (DO-INHERITABLE-CONSTRAINTS), and through constraints used by
;;; CONSTRAIN-REF-TYPE (to derive the type of a REF to a lambda-var).
;;;
;;; Consets must keep track of which lvars are EQL to a given lambda-var (result
;;; from a REF to the lambda-var): CONSET-LVAR-LAMBDA-VAR-EQL-P and
;;; CONSET-ADD-LVAR-LAMBDA-VAR-EQL.  This, as all other constraints, must of
;;; course be cleared when a lambda-var's constraints are dropped because of
;;; assignment.
;;;
;;; Consets must be able to add constraints to a given lambda-var
;;; (CONSET-ADD-CONSTRAINT), and to the set of variables EQL to a given
;;; lambda-var (CONSET-ADD-CONSTRAINT-TO-EQL).
;;;
;;; When a lambda-var is assigned to, all the constraints involving that variable
;;; must be dropped: constraint propagation is flow-sensitive, so the constraints
;;; relate to the variable at a given range of program point.  In such cases,
;;; constraint propagation calls CONSET-CLEAR-LAMBDA-VAR.
;;;
;;; Finally, one of the main strengths of constraint propagation in SBCL is the
;;; tracking of EQL variables to help constraint propagation.  When two variables
;;; are known to be EQL (e.g. after a branch), ADD-EQL-VAR-VAR-CONSTRAINT is
;;; called to add the EQL constraint, but also have each equality class inherit
;;; the other's (inheritable) constraints.
;;;
;;; On top of that, we have the usual bulk set operations: intersection, copy,
;;; equality or emptiness testing.  There's also union, but that's only an
;;; optimisation to avoid useless copies in ADD-TEST-CONSTRAINTS and
;;; FIND-BLOCK-TYPE-CONSTRAINTS.
