;;;; WITH-COMPILATION-UNIT and WITH-COMPILATION-VALUES

(defmacro with-compilation-unit (options &body body)
  "Affects compilations that take place within its dynamic extent. It is
intended to be eg. wrapped around the compilation of all files in the same system.

Following options are defined:

  :OVERRIDE Boolean-Form
      One of the effects of this form is to delay undefined warnings until the
      end of the form, instead of giving them at the end of each compilation.
      If OVERRIDE is NIL (the default), then the outermost
      WITH-COMPILATION-UNIT form grabs the undefined warnings. Specifying
      OVERRIDE true causes that form to grab any enclosed warnings, even if it
      is enclosed by another WITH-COMPILATION-UNIT.

  :POLICY Optimize-Declaration-Form
      Provides dynamic scoping for global compiler optimization qualities and
      restrictions, limiting effects of subsequent OPTIMIZE proclamations and
      calls to SB-EXT:RESTRICT-COMPILER-POLICY to the dynamic scope of BODY.

      If OVERRIDE is false, specified POLICY is merged with current global
      policy. If OVERRIDE is true, current global policy, including any
      restrictions, is discarded in favor of the specified POLICY.

      Supplying POLICY NIL is equivalent to the option not being supplied at
      all, ie. dynamic scoping of policy does not take place.

      This option is an SBCL-specific experimental extension: Interface
      subject to change.

  :SOURCE-NAMESTRING Namestring-Form
      Attaches the value returned by the Namestring-Form to the internal
      debug-source information as the namestring of the source file. Normally
      the namestring of the input-file for COMPILE-FILE is used: this option
      can be used to provide source-file information for functions compiled
      using COMPILE, or to override the input-file of COMPILE-FILE.

      If both an outer and an inner WITH-COMPILATION-UNIT provide a
      SOURCE-NAMESTRING, the inner one takes precedence. Unaffected
      by :OVERRIDE.

      This is an SBCL-specific extension.

  :SOURCE-PLIST Plist-Form
      Attaches the value returned by the Plist-Form to internal debug-source
      information of functions compiled in within the dynamic extent of BODY.

      Primarily for use by development environments, in order to eg. associate
      function definitions with editor-buffers. Can be accessed using
      SB-INTROSPECT:DEFINITION-SOURCE-PLIST.

      If an outer WITH-COMPILATION-UNIT form also provide a SOURCE-PLIST, it
      is appended to the end of the provided SOURCE-PLIST. Unaffected
      by :OVERRIDE.

      This is an SBCL-specific extension.

Examples:

  ;; Prevent proclamations from the file leaking, and restrict
  ;; SAFETY to 3 -- otherwise uses the current global policy.
  (with-compilation-unit (:policy '(optimize))
    (restrict-compiler-policy 'safety 3)
    (load \"foo.lisp\"))

  ;; Using default policy instead of the current global one,
  ;; except for DEBUG 3.
  (with-compilation-unit (:policy '(optimize debug)
                          :override t)
    (load \"foo.lisp\"))

  ;; Same as if :POLICY had not been specified at all: SAFETY 3
  ;; proclamation leaks out from WITH-COMPILATION-UNIT.
  (with-compilation-unit (:policy nil)
    (declaim (optimize safety))
    (load \"foo.lisp\"))

;;; The entry point for MAKE-LOAD-FORM support. When IR1 conversion
;;; finds a constant structure, it invokes this to arrange for proper
;;; dumping. If it turns out that the constant has already been
;;; dumped, then we don't need to do anything.
;;;
;;; If the constant hasn't been dumped, then we check to see whether
;;; we are in the process of creating it. We detect this by
;;; maintaining the special *CONSTANTS-BEING-CREATED* as a list of all
;;; the constants we are in the process of creating. Actually, each
;;; entry is a list of the constant and any init forms that need to be
;;; processed on behalf of that constant.
;;;
;;; It's not necessarily an error for this to happen. If we are
;;; processing the init form for some object that showed up *after*
;;; the original reference to this constant, then we just need to
;;; defer the processing of that init form. To detect this, we
;;; maintain *CONSTANTS-CREATED-SINCE-LAST-INIT* as a list of the
;;; constants created since the last time we started processing an
;;; init form. If the constant passed to emit-make-load-form shows up
;;; in this list, then there is a circular chain through creation
;;; forms, which is an error.
;;;
;;; If there is some intervening init form, then we blow out of
;;; processing it by throwing to the tag PENDING-INIT. The value we
;;; throw is the entry from *CONSTANTS-BEING-CREATED*. This is so the
;;; offending init form can be tacked onto the init forms for the
;;; circular object.
;;;
;;; If the constant doesn't show up in *CONSTANTS-BEING-CREATED*, then
;;; we have to create it. We call MAKE-LOAD-FORM and check if the
;;; result comes from MAKE-LOAD-FORM-SAVING-SLOTS, and if so we don't
;;; do anything. The dumper will eventually get its hands on the
;;; object and use the normal structure dumping noise on it.
;;;
;;; Otherwise, we bind *CONSTANTS-BEING-CREATED* and
;;; *CONSTANTS-CREATED-SINCE- LAST-INIT* and compile the creation form
;;; much the way LOAD-TIME-VALUE does. When this finishes, we tell the
;;; dumper to use that result instead whenever it sees this constant.
;;;
;;; Now we try to compile the init form. We bind
;;; *CONSTANTS-CREATED-SINCE-LAST-INIT* to NIL and compile the init
;;; form (and any init forms that were added because of circularity
;;; detection). If this works, great. If not, we add the init forms to
;;; the init forms for the object that caused the problems and let it
;;; deal with it.

  :OUTPUT-FILE
     The name of the FASL to output.  The returned pathname of the
     output file may differ from the pathname of the :OUTPUT-FILE
     parameter, e.g. when the latter is a designator for a directory.

  :VERBOSE
     If true, information indicating what file is being compiled is printed
     to *STANDARD-OUTPUT*.

  :PRINT
     If true, each top level form in the file is printed to *STANDARD-OUTPUT*.

  :EXTERNAL-FORMAT
     The external format to use when opening the source file.
      The default is :DEFAULT which uses the SB-EXT:*DEFAULT-SOURCE-EXTERNAL-FORMAT*.

  :BLOCK-COMPILE {NIL | :SPECIFIED | T}
     Determines whether multiple functions are compiled together as a unit,
     resolving function references at compile time.  NIL means that global
     function names are never resolved at compilation time.  :SPECIFIED means
     that names are resolved at compile-time when convenient (as in a
     self-recursive call), but the compiler doesn't combine top-level DEFUNs.
     With :SPECIFIED, an explicit START-BLOCK declaration will enable block
     compilation.  A value of T indicates that all forms in the file(s) should
     be compiled as a unit.  The default is the value of
     SB-EXT:*BLOCK-COMPILE-DEFAULT*, which is initially NIL.

  :ENTRY-POINTS
     This specifies a list of function names for functions in the file(s) that
     must be given global definitions.  This only applies to block
     compilation, and is useful mainly when :BLOCK-COMPILE T is specified on a
     file that lacks START-BLOCK declarations.  If the value is NIL (the
     default) then all functions will be globally defined.

  :TRACE-FILE
     If given, internal data structures are dumped to the specified
     file, or if a value of T is given, to a file of *.trace type
     derived from the input file name. (non-standard)

  :EMIT-CFASL
     (Experimental). If true, outputs the toplevel compile-time effects
     of this file into a separate .cfasl file."

;;; KLUDGE: Part of the ANSI spec for this seems contradictory:

;;;   the result is a logical pathname. If INPUT-FILE is a logical
;;;   pathname, it is translated into a physical pathname as if by
;;;   calling TRANSLATE-LOGICAL-PATHNAME.
;;; So I haven't really tried to make this precisely ANSI-compatible
;;; at the level of e.g. whether it returns logical pathname or a
;;; physical pathname. Patches to make it more correct are welcome.
;;; -- WHN 2000-12-09
;;;
;;; Issues of logical-pathname handling aside, I checked some other lisps
;;; to see what they do with the following two examples:
;;;  (COMPILE-FILE "a/b/file.lisp :output-file "x/y/z/")
;;;  (COMPILE-FILE "a/b/file.lisp :output-file "x/y/out")
;;; and it turns out that they don't implement the spirit of the law,
;;; forget about the letter of the law. The spirit (intent) is that regardless
;;; of how pathnames are handled, COMPILE-FILE-PATHNAME should tell you exactly
;;; what pathname the compiler would write into given the input and output to
;;; COMPILE-FILE. But they can't even do that much correctly.
;;; So forget about how merging "should" work - it's a crap shoot at best.

;;; ECL 16.1.3
;;; ----------
;;; (compile-file-pathname "a/b/file.lisp" :output-file #p"x/y/z/")
;;; #P"x/y/z/" ; ok, maybe it will do additional defaulting to get the name and type?
;;; (compile-file "a/b/file.lisp" :output-file #p"x/y/z/")
;;; Internal error:
;;;   ** Pathname without a physical namestring:
;;; Nope, it won't default them. However:
;;; (compile-file "a/b/file.lisp" :output-file #p"x/y/z/out")
;;; => #P"/tmp/sbcl/x/y/z/out"
;;; so it worked, but it failed to default the file type to '.fas'
;;; which it would have if nothing were specified.

;;; ABCL 1.7.1
;;; ----------
;;; (compile-file-pathname "a/b/file.lisp" :output-file #p"x/y/z/")
;;; #P"/tmp/sbcl/a/b/x/y/z/file.lisp" ; OK, so it says it merged input + output dirs
;;; but it didn't stick on a pathname-type. However
;;; (compile-file "a/b/file.lisp" :output-file #p"x/y/z/")
;;; ; Compiling /tmp/sbcl/a/b/file.lisp ...
;;; #<THREAD "interpreter" {E2B80EB}>: Debugger invoked on condition of type SIMPLE-ERROR
;;;   Pathname has no namestring:
;;; And now:
;;; (compile-file "a/b/file.lisp" :output-file #p"x/y/z/out.abcl")
;;; => #P"/tmp/sbcl/x/y/z/out.abcl" ; so it *didn't* actually merge dirs, which is fine
;;;
;;; But we try our best to give somewhat understandable semantics:
;;; * strongly prefer that all fasls have a pathname-type
;;;   whether or not the output was specified. However, if you are sadistic
;;;   (and/or enjoy being confusing to others), then :OUTPUT-FILE is permitted
;;;   to have :UNSPECIFIC as the type, and it will lack the '.fasl' suffix.
;;; * we can accept just a directory for the output (a namestring ending in "/"
;;;   on Unix) and will take the pathname-name from the input
;;; * we will never merge directories from the input to output
;;;
;;; It is unclear what should happen with
;;; (compile-file "sys:contrib;foo.lisp" :output-file "obj")
;;; Is "obj" on the logical host or the physical host?
