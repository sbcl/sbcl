;;; Do environment analysis on the code in COMPONENT. This involves
;;; various things:
;;;  1. Make an ENVIRONMENT structure for each non-LET LAMBDA, assigning
;;;     the LAMBDA-ENVIRONMENT for all LAMBDAs.
;;;  2. Find all values that need to be closed over by each
;;;     environment.
;;;  3. Scan the blocks in the component closing over non-local-exit
;;;     continuations.
;;;  4. Delete all non-top-level functions with no references. This
;;;     should only get functions with non-NULL kinds, since normal
;;;     functions are deleted when their references go to zero.

;;; comments. CLEANUP1 isn't mentioned in the code of this function.
;;; It is in code elsewhere, but if the comments for this function
;;; mention it they should explain the relationship to the other code.)

;;; If we do insert cleanup code, we check that BLOCK1 doesn't end in
;;; a "tail" local call.
;;;
;;; We don't need to adjust the ending cleanup of the cleanup block,
;;; since the cleanup blocks are inserted at the start of the DFO, and
;;; are thus never scanned.
