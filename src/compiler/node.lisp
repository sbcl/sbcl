;;; The front-end data structure (IR1) is composed of nodes and
;;; continuations. The general idea is that continuations contain
;;; top-down information and nodes contain bottom-up, derived
;;; information. A continuation represents a place in the code, while
;;; a node represents code that does something.
;;;
;;; This representation is more of a flow-graph than an augmented
;;; syntax tree. The evaluation order is explicitly represented in the
;;; linkage by continuations, rather than being implicit in the nodes
;;; which receive the the results of evaluation. This allows us to
;;; decouple the flow of results from the flow of control. A
;;; continuation represents both, but the continuation can represent
;;; the case of a discarded result by having no DEST.

;;; Note: Continuations have been split into CTRANs and LVARs. Control
;;; transfers inside a block are represented with CTRANs; data
;;; transfers are represented with LVARs. However, many of the

  ;;
  ;;    NIL
  ;;    an ordinary function, callable using local call
  ;;
  ;;    :LET
  ;;    a lambda that is used in only one local call, and has in
  ;;    effect been substituted directly inline. The return node is
  ;;    deleted, and the result is computed with the actual result
  ;;    lvar for the call.
  ;;
  ;;    :MV-LET
  ;;    Similar to :LET (as per FUNCTIONAL-LETLIKE-P), but the call
  ;;    is an MV-CALL.
  ;;
  ;;    :ASSIGNMENT
  ;;    similar to a LET (as per FUNCTIONAL-SOMEWHAT-LETLIKE-P), but
  ;;    can have more than one call as long as the calls all return to
  ;;    the same place.
  ;;
  ;;    :OPTIONAL
  ;;    a lambda that is an entry point for an OPTIONAL-DISPATCH.
  ;;    Similar to NIL, but requires greater caution, since local call
  ;;    analysis may create new references to this function. Also, the
  ;;    function cannot be deleted even if it has *no* references. The
  ;;    OPTIONAL-DISPATCH is in the LAMBDA-OPTIONAL-DISPATCH.
  ;;
  ;;    :EXTERNAL
  ;;    an external entry point lambda. The function it is an entry
  ;;    for is in the ENTRY-FUN slot.
  ;;
  ;;    :TOPLEVEL
  ;;    a top level lambda, holding a compiled top level form.
  ;;    Compiled very much like NIL, but provides an indication of
  ;;    top level context. A :TOPLEVEL lambda should have *no*
  ;;    references. Its ENTRY-FUN is a self-pointer.
  ;;
  ;;    :TOPLEVEL-XEP
  ;;    After a component is compiled, we clobber any top level code
  ;;    references to its non-closure XEPs with dummy FUNCTIONAL
  ;;    structures having this kind. This prevents the retained
  ;;    top level code from holding onto the IR for the code it
  ;;    references.
  ;;
  ;;    :ESCAPE
  ;;    :CLEANUP
  ;;    special functions used internally by CATCH and UNWIND-PROTECT.
  ;;    These are pretty much like a normal function (NIL), but are
  ;;    treated specially by local call analysis and stuff. Neither
  ;;    kind should ever be given an XEP even though they appear as
  ;;    args to funny functions. An :ESCAPE function is never actually
  ;;    called, and thus doesn't need to have code generated for it.
  ;;
  ;;    :DELETED
  ;;    This function has been found to be uncallable, and has been
  ;;    marked for deletion.
  ;;
  ;;    :ZOMBIE
  ;;    Effectless [MV-]LET; has no BIND node.
