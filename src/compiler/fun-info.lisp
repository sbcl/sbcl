;;; IR1 boolean function attributes
;;;
;;; There are a number of boolean attributes of known functions which
;;; we like to have in IR1. This information is mostly side effect
;;; information of a sort, but it is different from the kind of
;;; information we want in IR2. We aren't interested in a fine
;;; breakdown of side effects, since we do very little code motion on
;;; IR1. We are interested in some deeper semantic properties such as
;;; whether it is safe to pass stack closures to.
(!def-boolean-attribute ir1
  ;; may call functions that are passed as arguments. In order to
  ;; determine what other effects are present, we must find the
  ;; effects of all arguments that may be functions.

  ;; may fail to return during correct execution. Errors are O.K.
  ;; UNUSED, BEWARE OF BITROT.
  unwind
  ;; the (default) worst case. Includes all the other bad things, plus
  ;; any other possible bad thing. If this is present, the above bad
  ;; attributes will be explicitly present as well.
  any
  ;; all arguments are safe for dynamic extent.
  ;; (We used to have an UNSAFE attribute, which was basically the inverse
  ;; of this, but it was unused and bitrotted, so when we started making
  ;; use of the information we flipped the name and meaning the safe way
  ;; around.)
  dx-safe
  ;; may be constant-folded. The function has no side effects, but may
  ;; be affected by side effects on the arguments. e.g. SVREF, MAPC.
  ;; Functions that side-effect their arguments are not considered to
  ;; be foldable. Although it would be "legal" to constant fold them
  ;; (since it "is an error" to modify a constant), we choose not to
  ;; mark these functions as foldable in this database.
  foldable
  ;; may be eliminated if value is unused. The function has no side
  ;; effects except possibly cons. If a function might signal errors,
  ;; then it is not flushable even if it is movable, foldable or
  ;; unsafely-flushable. Implies UNSAFELY-FLUSHABLE. (In safe code
  ;; type checking of arguments is always performed by the caller, so
  ;; a function which SHOULD signal an error if arguments are not of
  ;; declared types may be FLUSHABLE.)
  flushable
  ;; unsafe call may be eliminated if value is unused. The function
  ;; has no side effects except possibly cons and signalling an error
  ;; in the safe code. If a function MUST signal errors, then it is
  ;; not unsafely-flushable even if it is movable or foldable.
  unsafely-flushable
  ;; return value is important, and ignoring it is probably a mistake.
  ;; Unlike the other attributes, this is used only for style
  ;; warnings and has no effect on optimization.
  important-result
  ;; may be moved with impunity. Has no side effects except possibly
  ;; consing, and is affected only by its arguments.
  ;; UNUSED, BEWARE OF BITROT.
  movable
  ;; The function is a true predicate likely to be open-coded. Convert
  ;; any non-conditional uses into (IF <pred> T NIL). Not usually
  ;; specified to DEFKNOWN, since this is implementation dependent,
  ;; and is usually automatically set by the DEFINE-VOP :CONDITIONAL
  ;; option.
  predicate
  ;; Inhibit any warning for compiling a recursive definition.
  ;; (Normally the compiler warns when compiling a recursive
  ;; definition for a known function, since it might be a botched
  ;; interpreter stub.)
  recursive
  ;; The function should always be translated by a VOP (i.e. it should
  ;; should never be converted into a full call).  This is used strictly
  ;; as a consistency checking mechanism inside the compiler during IR2
  ;; transformation.
  always-translatable
  ;; If a function is called with two arguments and the first one is a
  ;; constant, then the arguments will be swapped.
  commutative
  ;; Reoptimize this function if the node that follows it gets unlinked.
  reoptimize-when-unlinking
  ;; The function does not verify the arg count and must be always
  ;; called with the right arguments and can avoid passing NARGS.
  no-verify-arg-count
  ;; Arguments are can be passed unboxed, no type checking on entry is
  ;; performed, and the number of arguments passed in registers can be
  ;; greater than the standard number. Only fixed arguments can be used.
