;;;; This file implements local call analysis. A local call is a
;;;; function call between functions being compiled at the same time.
;;;; If we can tell at compile time that such a call is legal, then we
;;;; change the combination to call the correct lambda, mark it as
;;;; local, and add this link to our call graph. Once a call is local,
;;;; it is then eligible for let conversion, which places the body of
;;;; the function inline.
;;;;
;;;; We cannot always do a local call even when we do have the
;;;; function being called. Calls that cannot be shown to have legal
;;;; arg counts are not converted.

;;;; This software is part of the SBCL system. See the README file for
;;;; more information.

;;; for FUN.
;;;
;;; If FUN is a LAMBDA, then we check the number of arguments
;;; (conditional on policy) and call FUN with all the arguments.

;;; If FUN is an OPTIONAL-DISPATCH, then we dispatch off of the number
;;; of supplied arguments by doing do an = test for each entry-point,
;;; calling the entry with the appropriate prefix of the passed
;;; arguments.
;;;
;;; If there is a &MORE arg, then there are a couple of optimizations
;;; that we make (more for space than anything else):
;;; -- If MIN-ARGS is 0, then we make the more entry a T clause, since

;;; -- We can omit the = clause for the last entry-point, allowing the
;;;    case of 0 more args to fall through to the more entry.
;;;
;;; We don't bother to policy conditionalize wrong arg errors in
;;; optional dispatches, since the additional overhead is negligible
;;; compared to the cost of everything else going on.
;;;
;;; Note that if policy indicates it, argument type declarations in
;;; FUN will be verified. Since nothing is known about the type of the
;;; XEP arg vars, type checks will be emitted when the XEP's arg vars

;;;; LET conversion
;;;;
;;;; Converting to a LET has differing significance to various parts
;;;; of the compiler:
;;;; -- The body of a LET is spliced in immediately after the
;;;;    corresponding combination node, making the control transfer
;;;;    explicit and allowing LETs to be mashed together into a single
;;;;    block. The value of the LET is delivered directly to the
;;;;    original lvar for the call, eliminating the need to
;;;;    propagate information from the dummy result lvar.
;;;; -- As far as IR1 optimization is concerned, it is interesting in
;;;;    that there is only one expression that the variable can be bound
;;;;    to, and this is easily substituted for.
;;;; -- LETs are interesting to environment analysis and to the back
;;;;    end because in most ways a LET can be considered to be "the
;;;;    same function" as its home function.
;;;; -- LET conversion has dynamic scope implications, since control
;;;;    transfers within the same environment are local. In a local
;;;;    control transfer, cleanup code must be emitted to remove
;;;;    dynamic bindings that are no longer in effect.

;;; Set up the control transfer to the called CLAMBDA. We split the
;;; call block immediately after the call, and link the head of
;;; CLAMBDA to the call block. The successor block after splitting
;;; (where we return to) is returned.
;;;
;;; If the lambda is is a different component than the call, then we
;;; call JOIN-COMPONENTS. This only happens in block compilation
;;; before FIND-INITIAL-DFO.

;;; derived to not return at all. Since all tail local calls have
;;; already been converted to direct transfers, the only control
