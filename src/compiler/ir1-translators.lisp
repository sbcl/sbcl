;;; We now have a switch to decide whether relative pathnames
;;; can be stored in fasl files as their source name.
;;; Regardless of what ANSI says must be bound to *fooNAME* specials,
;;; the only sane choice for this switch is to use untruenames,
;;; because compilers should record source filenames _as_given_ for
;;; later consumption by linkers and debuggers. Attempting to convert
;;; to a truename fails miserably on symlink forests and
;;; content-addressable filesystems. Compare to a typical C compiler:
;;;  $ mkdir -p /tmp/a/b/c/d/e/f/g
;;;  $ cd /tmp/a/b/c/d
;;;  $ touch e/f/g/h.i
;;;  $ cc -g3 -S -o - e/f/g/h.i | grep file
;;;    .file        "h.i"
;;;    .file 1 "e/f/g/h.i"
;;; It has emitted a debug info with just a tail, and a debug info with
;;; the unaltered pathname, and not a truename in sight.
;;;
;;; But in Lisp we merge pathnames with the defaults, because CLHS says that
;;; "*compile-file-pathname* ... is bound to (pathname (merge-pathnames input-file))."
;;; and similarly for *load-pathname*.
;;; It's an implementation detail that we use the same information
;;; to bind *compile-file-pathname* and to store in the fasl though.
;;; But CLHS does *NOT* say that that the pathname of a source files as
;;; represented in its corresponding compiled object is a fully merged name
;;; - how would it? obtaining the source path isn't a specified thing -
;;; and that's our loophole to allow the choice.
;;; Another loophole is that *DEFAULT-PATHNAME-DEFAULTS* can always be #"".

;;; We could invent internal variables, like *COMPILE-FILE-PATHNAME-UNMERGED*
;;; to hold the right (useful) thing, when the *COMPILE-FILE-PATHNAME*
;;; holds the un-useful thing.
;;; Anyway, long story short, merging is all the more wrong when we went
;;; to heroic efforts to reverse-engineer the original pathname by
;;; scanning for "src/" as used to be done in LPNIFY-NAMESTRING.
;;; So name-contexts, at least in self-build, should use untruenameized
;;; un-merged pathnames. I'm not daring enough to change it for everyone.
;;; It defaults to what it should, and is changed before saving the image.
