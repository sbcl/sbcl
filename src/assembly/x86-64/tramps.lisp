;;; the closure trampoline - entered when a global function is a closure
;;; and the function is called "by name" (normally, as when it is the
;;; head of a form) via an FDEFN. Register %RAX holds the fdefn address,
;;; but the simple-fun which underlies the closure expects %RAX to be the
;;; closure itself. So we grab the closure out of the fdefn pointed to,
;;; then jump to the simple-fun that the closure points to.
