for 0.7.0:

* filed off the roughest edges (or, perhaps, at least hammered down the
	protruding rusty nails and snipped off the trailing razor wire,
	leaving some filing for later:-) from the monster
	EVAL/EVAL-WHEN/%COMPILE/DEFUN/DEFSTRUCT cleanup:
	** made inlining DEFUN inside MACROLET work again
	** made %COMPILE set up debugging data more like the way the
		debugger expects (and maybe even completely
		correctly:-)
* incompatible changes listed in NEWS:
	** changed debugger prompt to "5]", "5[2]", "5[3]", etc.
	** changed default output representation of *PRINT-ESCAPE*-ed
		unprintable ASCII characters to #\Nul, #\Soh, etc.
* some easy FIXMEs with high disruptive potential:
	** Search lists go away.
	** Grep for ~D and and change most of them to ~S.
* more renaming in global external names:
	** used DEFINE-THE-FOO-THING and DEFFOO style consistently (and 
		deprecated supported extensions named in the DEF-FOO
		style, e.g. SB-ALIEN:DEF-ALIEN-ROUTINE)
	** reserved DO-FOO-style names for iteration macros
	** finished s/FUNCTION/FUN/
	** s/VARIABLE/VAR/
	** s/TOP-LEVEL/TOPLEVEL/
* global style systematization:
	** s/#'(lambda/(lambda/
	** four-space indentation in C
=======================================================================
for early 0.7.x:

* building with CLISP (or explaining why not)
* faster bootstrapping (both make.sh and slam.sh)
	** added mechanisms for automatically finding dead code, and
		used them to remove dead code
	** moved stuff from warm init into cold init where possible
		(so that slam.sh will run faster and also just because
		ideally everything would be in cold init)
	** profiled and tweaked
* more EVAL/EVAL-WHEN/%COMPILE/DEFUN/DEFSTRUCT cleanup:
	** made %COMPILE understand magicality of DEFUN FOO
		w.r.t. e.g. preexisting inlineness of FOO
	** used %COMPILE where COMPILE-TOP-LEVEL used to be used
	** removed now-redundant COMPILE-TOP-LEVEL and 
		FUNCTIONAL-KIND=:TOP-LEVEL stuff from the compiler
	** made FUNCTION-NAME logic work on closures, so that
		various public functions like CL:PACKAGEP which
		are now implemented as closures (because
		they're structure slot accessors) won't be so
		nasty in the debugger
	** %SLOT-ACCESSOR/%SLOT-ACCESSOR stuff can probably go away,
		since we inline expand all slot accessors into 
		%INSTANCE-REF and the optimizer knows all it needs
		to know about that.
* rewrote long-standing confusing error restarts for redefining
	DEFSTRUCTs
* outstanding embarrassments
	** cut-and-pasted DEF-BOOLEAN-ATTRIBUTE (maybe easier to fix
		now that EVAL-WHEN does what it should..)
	** incomplete manual
	** :IGNORE-ERRORS-P cruft in stems-and-flags.lisp-expr
	** weird double-loading (first in GENESIS, then in warm init)
		of src/assembly/target/*.lisp stuff, and the associated
		weirdness of the half-baked state (compiler almost but
		not quite ready for prime time..) of the system after
		cold init
* fixups now feasible because of pre7 changes
	** ANSIfied DECLAIM INLINE stuff (deprecating MAYBE-INLINE)
* miscellaneous simple refactoring
	* belated renaming:
		** renamed %PRIMITIVE to %VOP
	* These days ANSI C has inline functions, so..
		** redid many cpp macros as inline functions: 
			HeaderValue, Pointerp, CEILING, ALIGNED_SIZE,
			GET_FREE_POINTER, SET_FREE_POINTER,
			GET_GC_TRIGGER, SET_GC_TRIGGER, GetBSP, SetBSP,
			os_trunc_foo(), os_round_up_foo()
		** removed various avoid-evaluating-C-macro-arg-twice
			cruft
* added mechanisms for automatically finding dead symbols is
	package-data.lisp-expr (i.e. those symbols not bound,
	fbound, defined as types, or whatever), and used them
	to remove dead symbols
* made system handle stack overflow safely unless SAFETY is dominated
	by SPEED or SPACE
=======================================================================
for 1.0:

* refactored in preparation for moving CLOS into cold init and merging
	SB-PCL:FOO with CL:FOO (for FOO=CLASS, FOO=CLASS-OF, etc.)
	** systematized support for MOP (new regression tests, maybe
		new SB-MOP package..) to try to make sure things don't
		get mislaid in the upcoming CLOS restructuring
	** extracted type system from SB-KERNEL into new SB-TYPE
		package
	** reimplemented GENERIC-FUNCTION as a primitive object (or
		maybe made SB-MOP:FUNCALLABLE-STANDARD-OBJECT the
		primitive object, and then let GENERIC-FUNCTIONs
		inherit from that) instead of structures with
		:ALTERNATE-METACLASS and funcallableness. Now
		FUNCALLABLE-INSTANCE can go away. (And now the new
		funcallable primitive objects need to go into
		collections like *FUN-HEADER-WIDETAGS* where
		FUNCALLABLE-INSTANCE objects used to be.)
	** reimplemented CONDITIONs as primitive objects instead of 
		structures with :ALTERNATE-METACLASS. Now (between
		this and the change to GENERIC-FUNCTIONs)
		DEFSTRUCT :ALTERNATE-METACLASS can go away.
	** (maybe) Now INSTANCE_POINTER_LOWTAG can become just
		STRUCTURE_POINTER_LOWTAG, and the concept of
		SB-KERNEL:INSTANCE (including INSTANCEP, 
		(SPECIFIER-TYPE 'INSTANCE), etc.) can go away.
* moved CLOS into cold init, in order to allow CLOS to be used in the
	implementation of the core system (e.g. the type system and the
	compiler) and in order to support merger of CL:CLASS with 
	SB-PCL:CLASS
* (maybe) eliminated warm init altogether in favor of cold init
* (maybe, especially if warm init can be eliminated) rationalized
	the build process, fixing miscellaneous pre-0.5.0 stuff that's
	transparently not the right thing
	** removed separate build directories, now just building in 
		place with .sbclcoldfasl extensions
* (maybe) more refactoring in preparation for merging SB-PCL:FOO
	into CL:FOO: reimplemented type system OO dispatch
	(!DEFINE-TYPE-METHOD, etc.) in terms of CLOS OO dispatch
* merged SB-PCL:FOO into CL:FOO (and similarly CLASS-OF, etc.)
* added some automatic tests for basic binary compatibility, in hopes
	that it might be practical to maintain binary compatibility
	between minor maintenance releases on the stable branch (but no
	promises, sorry, since I've never tried to do this before, and 
	have no idea how much of a pain this'll be)
=======================================================================
other priorities, no particular time:

* bug fixes, especially really annoying bugs (ANSI or not) and any
	ANSI bugs (i.e. not just bugs in extras like the debugger or
	"declarations are assertions", but violations of the standard)
* better communication with the outside world (scratching WHN's
	personal itch): I don't want socket-level stuff so much as I
	want RPC-level or higher (CORBA?) interfaces and (possibly
	through RPC or CORBA) GUI support
=======================================================================
important but out of scope (for WHN, anyway: Patches from other people
are still welcome!) until after 1.0:
	* DYNAMIC-EXTENT
	* sadly deteriorated support for ANSI-style block compilation
		(static linking of DEFUNs within a single file or 
		WITH-COMPILATION-UNIT)
	* various GC issues (exuberant cut-and-paste coding,
		possibly dangerously over-conservative handling
		of neighbors of function objects, general GC efficiency)
	* package issues other than SB!TYPE, SB!MOP, and dead exported
		symbols
	* Any systematic effort to fix compiler consistency checks is
		out of scope. (However, it still might be possible to
		determine that some or all of them are hopelessly stale
		and delete them.)
===============================================================================
other known issues with no particular target date:

bugs listed on the man page

hundreds of FIXME notes in the sources from WHN

various other unfinished business from CMU CL and before, marked with 
  "XX" or "XXX" or "###" or "***" or "???" or "pfw" or "@@@@" or "zzzzz"
or probably also other codes that I haven't noticed or have forgotten.

(Things marked as KLUDGE are in general things which are ugly or
confusing, but that, for whatever reason, may stay that way
indefinitely.)

"Accumulation of half-understood design decisions eventually chokes a
program as a water weed chokes a canal. By refactoring you can ensure
that your full understanding of how the program should be designed is
always reflected in the program. As a water weed quickly spreads its
tendrils, partially understood design decisions quickly spread their
effects throughout your program. No one or two or even ten individual
actions will be enough to eradicate the problem."
