# "When we build software, it's a good idea to have a reliable method

# starting from the same source to end up in the same result. That's

# The make-host-*.sh scripts are run on the cross-compilation host,
# and the make-target-*.sh scripts are run on the target machine. In
# ordinary compilation, we just do these phases consecutively on the
# same machine, but if you wanted to cross-compile from one machine
# which supports Common Lisp to another which does not (yet:-) support
# Common Lisp, you could do something like this:
#   Create copies of the source tree on both the host and the target.
#   Read the make-config.sh script carefully and emulate it by hand
#     on both machines (e.g. creating "target"-named symlinks to
#     identify the target architecture).
#   On the host system:
#     SBCL_XC_HOST=<whatever> sh make-host-1.sh
#   Copy src/runtime/genesis/*.h from the host system to the target
#     system.
#   On the target system:
#     sh make-target-1.sh
#   Copy src/runtime/sbcl.nm and output/stuff-groveled-from-headers.lisp
#     from the target system to the host system.
#   On the host system:
#     SBCL_XC_HOST=<whatever> sh make-host-2.sh
#   Copy output/cold-sbcl.core from the host system to the target system.
#   On the target system:
#     sh make-target-2.sh
#     sh make-target-contrib.sh
# Or, if you can set up the files somewhere shared (with NFS, AFS, or
# whatever) between the host machine and the target machine, the basic
# procedure above should still work, but you can skip the "copy" steps.
# If you can use rsync on the host machine, you can call make-config.sh
# with:
# --host-location=user@host-machine:<rsync path to host sbcl directory>
# and the make-target-*.sh scripts will take care of transferring the
# necessary files.
