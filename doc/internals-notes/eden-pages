Design for new page types in support of asynchronous
determination of ambiguous roots.

Background: concurrency is only a problem pertinent
to generation 0 with open per-thread allocation regions.
Generations 1 and up are manipulated by the GC and will not have
open regions when threads are initially stopped.
If only generation 0 is to be collected, then each
thread can stack its own stack.
If generation 1 or higher is to be collected,
the GC'ing thread will have to scan all stacks.

PAGE_TYPE_EDEN_CONS:
* Pages are initially filled with 0xff.
* All objects are conses.
* Examining an arbitrary word will, with 100% certainty,
  determine that the word starts an object or does not.
  (Any <-1,-1> wordpair can not possibly be a cons)
* Differs from CONS in that ordinary CONS is not prezeroed.

PAGE_TYPE_EDEN_BOXED:
* Pages are initially zero-filled.
* All objects are headered.
* No object contains a raw slot.
* Examining an arbitrary word will, with 100% certainty,
  determine that the word starts an object or does not.
  (Any word containing 0 can not possibly start an object.)
* Acceptable primitive types:
  - instance with no raw slots
  - funinstance without embedded trampoline
  - ratio, (complex rational)
  - closure, value-cell, weak-pointer
  - simple-array, simple-vector-nil, simple-vector
  - complex-{base-string,character-string,bit-vector,vector,array}
* Differs from BOXED in that ordinary BOXED may not contain
  any object that demands a type-specific scavenge method.

PAGE_TYPE_EDEN_MIXED:
* Pages need not be zero-filled (in theory).
* All objects are headered.
* Objects potentially contain one or more raw slots.
* A bitmap of object start addresses is maintained by the allocator.
* Acceptable primitive types:
  - bignum, double-float, (complex float)
  - symbol, mixed instance and/or instances made by %MAKE-INSTANCE
  - funinstance with embedded trampoline
  - sap, fdefn, simd-pack{-256}
  - simple-unboxed-vector
* Differs from MIXED in that normal MIXED has no bitmap and will
  usually not contain instances that lack raw slots.

Similarities:
* Type-specific scavenge methods are required for EDEN pages
  except for CONS.
  In the case of BOXED, this is due to presence of weak pointers,
  weak vectors, and address-based and/or weak KV storage vectors.
  For MIXED, this is required to avoid seeing raw bits.
* Pinned objects can promote beyond gen0, but the page type remains
  as EDEN_type because it would take more computation to decide whether
  to turn a page into something different.
  Additionally it might not be possible to change because:
  - EDEN_BOXED can hold the union of ordinary BOXED and MIXED
  - EDEN_MIXED can hold the union of ordinary MIXED and UNBOXED

Caution: this writeup only applies to x86-64.
Ensuring visibility of writes for relaxed-memory-order machines
is an issue. Something can possibly be done involving sys_membarrier.
