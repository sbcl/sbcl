@chapter Extensible Streams

SBCL supports various extensions of ANSI Common Lisp streams.

@table @strong
@item Bivalent Streams
A type of stream that can read and write both @code{character} and
@code{(unsigned-byte 8)} values.

@item Gray Streams
User-overloadable CLOS classes whose instances can be used as Lisp
streams (e.g. passed as the first argument to @code{format}).

@item Simple Streams
The bundled contrib module @dfn{sb-simple-streams} implements a subset
of the Franz Allegro simple-streams proposal.

@section Bivalent Streams

A @dfn{bivalent stream} can be used to read and write both
@code{character} and @code{(unsigned-byte 8)} values.  A bivalent
stream is created by calling @code{open} with the argument @code{:element-type
:default}.  On such a stream, both binary and character data can be
read and written with the usual input and output functions.

@c Horrible visual markup
@quotation
Streams are @emph{not} created bivalent by default for performance
reasons.  Bivalent streams are incompatible with
@code{fast-read-char}, an internal optimization in sbcl's stream
machinery that bulk-converts octets to characters and implements a
fast path through @code{read-char}.
@end quotation

@node Gray Streams
@section Gray Streams


The Gray Streams interface is a widely supported extension that
provides for definition of CLOS-extensible stream classes.  Gray
stream classes are implemented by adding methods to generic functions
analogous to Common Lisp's standard I/O functions.  Instances of Gray
stream classes may be used with any I/O operation where a non-Gray
stream can, provided that all required methods have been implemented
suitably.

@node Gray Streams classes
@subsection Gray Streams classes

The defined Gray Stream classes are these:

@include class-sb-gray-fundamental-stream.texinfo
@include class-sb-gray-fundamental-input-stream.texinfo

@noindent
The function input-stream-p will return true of any generalized
instance of fundamental-input-stream.

@include class-sb-gray-fundamental-output-stream.texinfo

@noindent
The function output-stream-p will return true of any generalized
instance of fundamental-output-stream.

@include class-sb-gray-fundamental-binary-stream.texinfo

@noindent
Note that instantiable subclasses of fundamental-binary-stream should
provide (or inherit) an applicable method for the generic function
stream-element-type.

@include class-sb-gray-fundamental-character-stream.texinfo
@include class-sb-gray-fundamental-binary-input-stream.texinfo
@include class-sb-gray-fundamental-binary-output-stream.texinfo
@include class-sb-gray-fundamental-character-input-stream.texinfo
@include class-sb-gray-fundamental-character-output-stream.texinfo
