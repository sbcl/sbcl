(VECTOR NIL)s are strings only if you believe that the definition involving union
types prevails over the ample amount of exposition in the spec, as well as utility
of the resulting strings, and common sense.

I tested 9 other implementations, and 7 of them agree that:
  (SUBTYPEP '(SIMPLE-ARRAY NIL (*)) 'STRING) => NIL and T

They have differing behaviors as to effect of make-string and make-array as follows:

Allegro (10.1 Free Express Edition):
 (SIMPLE-ARRAY NIL (*)) exists but does not satisfy STRINGP
 (make-string 1 :element-type NIL) returns a (SIMPLE-ARRAY CHARACTER (1))

Clasp (built from git rev 6b8047c2 @ 2020-10-22):
 (make-array 1 :element-type NIL) signals error
 (make-string 1 :element-type NIL) returns a (SIMPLE-ARRAY CHARACTER (1))

Clozure (v1.12):
 (make-array 1 :element-type NIL) returns (SIMPLE-VECTOR 1)
 (make-string 1 :element-type NIL) returns a (SIMPLE-BASE-STRING 1)

CMUCL (version 20d Unicode):
 (make-array 1 :element-type nil) returns (SIMPLE-BASE-STRING 1)
 as does MAKE-STRING.

ECL (version 20.4.24):
 (make-array 1 :element-type NIL) says
  "ECL does not support arrays with element type NIL"
 (make-string 1 :element-type NIL) returns a (SIMPLE-ARRAY BASE-CHAR (1))

GCL (version 2.6.12 CLtL1):
 (type-of (make-array 1 :element-type nil)) => VECTOR
 (array-element-type (make-string 1 :element-type nil)) => STRING-CHAR

MKCL (version 1.1.11):
 (make-array 1 :element-type NIL) returns a (VECTOR NIL 1)
 (make-string 1 :element-type NIL) returns a (SIMPLE-BASE-STRING 1)

Of the dissenters, they return T and T from the subtypep expression above
though their behavioral differences from MAKE-ARRAY to MAKE-STRING
present compelling evidence that at least in their API they disfavor considering
an object a string if it has element type NIL, hence MAKE-STRING upgrades NIL
to a nonempty type.
ABCL (version 1.7.1):
 (type-of (make-array 1 :element-type nil)) => (NIL-VECTOR 1)
 (type-of (make-string 1 :element-type nil)) => (SIMPLE-BASE-STRING 1)
 Also: (make-string 1 :element-type 'ratio) => "^@" ; the type is just ignored
CLISP (version 2.49.92):
 (type-of (make-array 1 :element-type nil)) => (SIMPLE-ARRAY NIL (1))
 (type-of (make-string 1 :element-type nil)) => (SIMPLE-BASE-STRING 1)

And one more Lisp implementation which matches none of the above-
Lispworks personal edition 7.1:
  (make-array 1 :element-type nil) signals
    ERROR: (ARRAY NIL) is an illegal type specifier.
  (make-string 1 :element-type nil) signals
    ERROR: (ARRAY NIL) is an illegal type specifier.
  (subtypep '(vector nil) 'string) signals
    ERROR: (ARRAY NIL (*)) is an illegal type specifier.

Hence (SIMPLE-ARRAY NIL (*)) is most plausibly not regarded as a string,
the ANSI compliance test suite notwithstanding.
And the range of implementation choices suggest that users can not reasonably
claim that any particular result from these edge cases constitutes a bug.
