;;;; -*- Lisp -*-

;;;; the specifications of target packages, except for a few things
;;;; which are handled elsewhere by other mechanisms:
;;;;   * any SHADOWing and nickname hackery;
;;;;   * the standard, non-SBCL-specific packages COMMON-LISP,
;;;;     COMMON-LISP-USER, and KEYWORD.
;;;;
;;;; The packages are named SB!FOO here and elsewhere in
;;;; cross-compilation, in order to avoid collision with possible
;;;; corresponding SB-FOO packages in the cross-compilation host.
;;;; They're renamed to SB-FOO later, after we've departed from the xc
;;;; mothership and the danger of namespace collision is past.

;;;; This software is part of the SBCL system. See the README file for
;;;; more information.
;;;;
;;;; This software is derived from the CMU CL system, which was
;;;; written at Carnegie Mellon University and released into the
;;;; public domain. The software is in the public domain and is
;;;; provided with absolutely no warranty. See the COPYING and CREDITS
;;;; files for more information.

;;;; KLUDGE: To make it easier for emacs to autoindent this file nicely
;;;; (which prevents spurious conflicts in CVS) each longish list should
;;;; have only one string on the first line. Silly, but there you go.

;;;; NOTE:
;;;; It is generally not necessary to use reader conditionals
;;;; within this file. If A-NICE-FUNCTION is external in SB-KERNEL
;;;; but not defined for a particular backend, it will not get
;;;; interned during cold load, and hence will not exist in the target.
;;;; This is exactly as desired - it is not necessary for the writer
;;;; of architecture-specific code to clutter up the list of package
;;;; definitions to avoid exporting some stuff. You just export what you
;;;; need, and genesis will do the right thing. Most of the pre-existing
;;;; conditionals are historical baggage, and should be removed.
;;;; EXCEPTION: packages whose symbols are created mainly during
;;;; warm load might have a reason to use reader conditionals.
;;;; For those packages, all symbols listed here are interned during
;;;; genesis, since otherwise the symbols would all disappear,
;;;; and then warm load would intern them as internals, not externals.
;;;; This list of exceptional packages can be found in the
;;;; definition of the FINISH-SYMBOLS function.

   ;; FIXME: This package is awfully huge. It'd probably be good to
   ;; split it. There's at least one natural way to split it: the
   ;; implementation of the Lisp type system (e.g. TYPE-INTERSECTION and
   ;; SPECIFIER-TYPE) could move to a separate package SB!TYPE. (There's
   ;; lots of stuff which currently uses the SB!KERNEL package which
   ;; doesn't actually use the type system stuff.) And maybe other
   ;; possible splits too:
   ;;   * Pull GC stuff (*GC-INHIBIT*, *GC-PENDING*, etc.)
   ;;     out into SB-GC.
   ;;   * Pull special case implementations of sequence functions (e.g.
   ;;     %MAP-TO-LIST-ARITY-1 and %FIND-POSITION-IF-NOT) and
   ;;     other sequence function implementation grot into SB-SEQ.
   ;;   * Pull all the math stuff (%ACOS, %COSH, WORD-LOGICAL-AND...)
   ;;     into SB-MATH.
   ;;   * Pull all the array stuff (%ARRAY-DATA-VECTOR,
   ;;     WITH-ARRAY-DATA, ALLOCATE-VECTOR, HAIRY-DATA-VECTOR-REF...)
   ;;     into SB-ARRAY.
   ;;   * Pull all the streams stuff out into SB-STREAM.
   ;;   * Pull all the OBJECT-NOT-FOO symbols out. Maybe we could even
   ;;     figure out a way to stop exporting them? Failing that,
   ;;     they could be in SB-INTERR.
   ;;     Or better still, since error names are basically meaningless except
   ;;     for the ~18 errors that are _not_ object-not-<x>, stop naming them.
   ;;     C just needs a map from number -> string-to-show.
