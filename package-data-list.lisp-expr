;;;; the specifications of target packages, except for a few things
;;;; which are handled elsewhere by other mechanisms:
;;;;   * any SHADOWing and nickname hackery;
;;;;   * the standard, non-SBCL-specific packages COMMON-LISP,
;;;;     COMMON-LISP-USER, and KEYWORD.

;;;; The packages are named SB!FOO here and elsewhere in
;;;; cross-compilation, in order to avoid collision with possible
;;;; corresponding SB-FOO packages in the cross-compilation host.
;;;; They're renamed to SB-FOO later, after we've departed from the xc
;;;; mothership and the danger of namespace collision is past.

;;;; This software is part of the SBCL system. See the README file for

;;;; This software is derived from the CMU CL system, which was
;;;; written at Carnegie Mellon University and released into the
;;;; public domain. The software is in the public domain and is
;;;; provided with absolutely no warranty. See the COPYING and CREDITS
;;;; files for more information.

;;;; KLUDGE: To make it easier for emacs to autoindent this file nicely
;;;; (which prevents spurious conflicts in CVS) each longish list should
;;;; have only one string on the first line. Silly, but there you go.

   ;;     %MAP-TO-LIST-ARITY-1 and %FIND-POSITION-IF-NOT) and
   ;;     other sequence function implementation grot into SB-SEQ.
   ;;   * Pull all the math stuff (%ACOS, %COSH, WORD-LOGICAL-AND...)
   ;;     into SB-MATH.
   ;;   * Pull all the array stuff (%ARRAY-DATA-VECTOR, %RAW-REF-LONG,
   ;;     WITH-ARRAY-DATA, ALLOCATE-VECTOR, HAIRY-DATA-VECTOR-REF...)
   ;;     into SB-ARRAY.
   ;;   * Pull all the streams stuff out into SB-STREAM.
   ;;   * Pull all the OBJECT-NOT-FOO symbols out. Maybe we could even
   ;;     figure out a way to stop exporting them? Failing that,
