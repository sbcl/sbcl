  "Create a new lexical environment by augmenting ENV with new information.

   VARIABLE
     is a list of symbols to introduce as new variable bindings.

   SYMBOL-MACRO
     is a list symbol macro bindings of the form (name definition).

   MACRO
     is a list of macro definitions of the form (name definition), where
     definition is a function of two arguments (a form and an environment).

   FUNCTION
     is a list of symbols to introduce as new local function bindings.

   DECLARE
     is a list of declaration specifiers. Declaration specifiers attach to the
     new variable or function bindings as if they appeared in let, let*, flet

  :FUNCTION

  :MACRO
    NAME refers to a macro.

  :SPECIAL-FORM

The second value is true if NAME is bound locally.

The third value is an alist describing the declarations that apply to
the function NAME. Standard declaration specifiers that may appear in
CARS of the alist include:

  DYNAMIC-EXTENT
    If the CDR is T, NAME has been declared DYNAMIC-EXTENT. If the CDR
    is NIL, the alist element may be omitted.

  INLINE
    The CDR is one of the symbols INLINE, NOTINLINE, or NIL, to
    indicate if the function has been declared INLINE or NOTINLINE. If
    the CDR is NIL the alist element may be omitted.

  FTYPE
    The CDR is the type specifier associated with NAME, or the symbol
    FUNCTION if there is functional type declaration or proclamation
    associated with NAME. If the CDR is FUNCTION the alist element may
    be omitted.

        Use of :LATE deprecated functions signals a full WARNING at

        Use of :FINAL deprecated functions signals a full WARNING at
