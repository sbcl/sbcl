;;;; win32 socket operations
;;;; these have all been done by hand since I can't seem
;;;; to get my head around the sb-grovel stuff

;;;; Winsock requires us to convert HANDLES to/from
;;;; file descriptors, so I've added an additional
;;;; package for the actual winsock alien defs, and then
;;;; in the sockint package, we implement wrappers that
;;;; handle the conversion.

;;; these are all of the basic structure alien defs
(in-package :sockint)

;;;; we are now going back to the normal sockint
;;;; package where we will redefine all of the above
;;;; functions, converting between HANDLES and fds
