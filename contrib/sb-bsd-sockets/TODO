Things To Do - Urgent!    (with apologies to Douglas Adams)

I probably have opinions about how to do most of these.  Even if not,
I almost certainly have opinions on how not to.  Send me a proposal
before spending serious amounts of time on it.

- the rest of the functions.  A socket-send that doesn't use streams
would be a good one

- the rest of the errors

- the rest of the socket options: integer and boolean socket-level
options are in but need odd ones, plus tcp, udp, ip

- async name service lookups.

- write tests for socket-name and socket-peername
