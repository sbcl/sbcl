Having an ASDF installed and registered is the normal way of configuring ASDF to upgrade itself,         and having an old version registered is a configuration error.

In the future, you may want to either:         (a) upgrade this configured ASDF to a newer version,         (b) install a newer ASDF and register it in front of the former in your configuration, or         (c) uninstall or unregister this and any other old version of ASDF from your configuration.
