;;; 1) structs don't have within-file location info.  problem for the
;;;   structure itself, accessors, the copier and the predicate
;;; 3) error handling.  Signal random errors, or handle and resignal 'our'
;;;   error, or return NIL?
;;; 4) FIXMEs

;;; This interface is tremendously experimental.

;;; For the moment I'm taking the view that FDEFN is an internal
;;; object (one out of one CMUCL developer surveyed didn't know what
;;; they were for), so these routines deal in FUNCTIONs

;;; Find callers and callees by looking at the constant pool of
;;; compiled code objects.  We assume every fdefn object in the
;;; constant pool corresponds to a call to that function.  A better
;;; strategy would be to use the disassembler to find actual
;;; call-sites.

;; FIXME[1]: this is quite clearly intended to do just about the same thing
;;           as CTU:FIND-NAMED-CALLEES yet the two are unnecessarily different.
;; FIXME[2]: for at least #+linkage-space we should disassemble FUNCTION
;;           because the stored linkage indices underestimate the answer.
;;           The gain from doing it right is that code constants overestimate
;;           especially if >1 simple-fun is present in the code.

indicates the general type of allocation: :IMMEDIATE, :HEAP, :STACK,

Possible secondary return value provides additional information about the
allocation.

For :HEAP objects the secondary value is a plist:

  :SPACE
    Indicates the heap segment the object is allocated in.

  :GENERATION
    Is the current generation of the object: 0 for nursery, 6 for pseudo-static
    generation loaded from core. (GENCGC and :SPACE :DYNAMIC only.)

  :LARGE
    Indicates a \"large\" object subject to non-copying
    promotion. (GENCGC and :SPACE :DYNAMIC only.)

  :BOXED
    Indicates that the object is allocated in a boxed region. Unboxed
    allocation is used for eg. specialized arrays after they have survived one
    collection. (GENCGC and :SPACE :DYNAMIC only.)

  :PINNED
    Indicates that the page(s) on which the object resides are kept live due
    to conservative references. Note that object may reside on a pinned page
    even if :PINNED in NIL if the GC has not had the need to mark the the page
    as pinned. (GENCGC and :SPACE :DYNAMIC only.)

  :WRITE-PROTECTED
    Indicates that the page on which the object starts is write-protected,
    which indicates for :BOXED objects that it hasn't been written to since
    the last GC of its generation. (GENCGC and :SPACE :DYNAMIC only.)

  :PAGE
    The index of the page the object resides on. (GENGC and :SPACE :DYNAMIC
    only.)

For :STACK objects secondary value is the thread on whose stack the object is
allocated.

Expected use-cases include introspection to gain insight into allocation and
GC behaviour and restricting memoization to heap-allocated arguments.
